Description: tool to load and stress a computer
 stress-ng can stress various subsystems of a computer.  It can stress load
 CPU, cache, disk, memory, socket and pipe I/O, scheduling and much more.
 stress-ng is a re-write of the original stress tool by Amos Waterland but
 has many additional features such as specifying the number of bogo operations
 to run, execution metrics, a stress verification on memory and compute
 operations and considerably more stress mechanisms.
