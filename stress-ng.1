.SH NAME
stress\-ng \- a tool to load and stress a computer system
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stress\-ng
[\fIOPTION \fR[\fIARG\fR]] ...
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
stress\-ng will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It
was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well
as the various operating system kernel interfaces.
stress\-ng also has a wide range of CPU specific stress tests that exercise
floating point, integer, bit manipulation and control flow.
.PP
stress\-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip
hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating
system bugs that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use
stress\-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot
on poorly designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing
which may be difficult to stop.
.PP
stress\-ng can also measure test throughput rates; this can be
useful to observe performance changes across different
operating system releases or types of hardware. However, it has never been
intended to be used as a precise benchmark test suite, so do NOT use it
in this manner.
.PP
Running stress\-ng with root privileges will adjust out of memory settings
on Linux systems to make the stressors unkillable in low memory situations,
so use this judiciously.  With the appropriate privilege, stress\-ng can allow
the ionice class and ionice levels to be adjusted, again, this should be
used with care.
.PP
One can specify the number of processes to invoke per type of stress test;
specifying a negative or zero value will select the number of processors
available as defined by sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B General stress\-ng control options:
.TP
.B \-\-abort
this option will force all running stressors to abort (terminate) if any
other stressor terminates prematurely because of a failure.
.TP
.B \-\-aggressive
enables more file, cache and memory aggressive options. This may slow tests
down, increase latencies and reduce the number of bogo ops as well as changing
the balance of user time vs system time used depending on the type of stressor
being used.
.TP
.B \-a N, \-\-all N, \-\-parallel N
start N instances of all stressors in parallel. If N is less than zero, then
the number of CPUs online is used for the number of instances.  If N is zero,
then the number of CPUs in the system is used.
.TP
.B \-b N, \-\-backoff N
wait N microseconds between the start of each stress worker process. This
allows one to ramp up the stress tests over time.
.TP
.B \-\-class name
specify the class of stressors to run. Stressors are classified into one or
more of the following classes: cpu, cpu-cache, device, io, interrupt,
filesystem, memory, network, os, pipe, scheduler and vm.  Some stressors fall
into just one class. For example the 'get' stressor is just in the 'os'
class. Other stressors fall into more than one class, for example,
the 'lsearch' stressor falls into the 'cpu', 'cpu-cache' and 'memory' classes
as it exercises all these three.  Selecting a specific class will run all
the stressors that fall into that class only when run with the \-\-sequential
option.

Specifying a name followed by a question mark (for example \-\-class vm?) will
print out all the stressors in that specific class.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-dry\-run
parse options, but do not run stress tests. A no-op.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
show help.
.TP
.B \-\-ignite\-cpu
alter kernel controls to try and maximize the CPU. This requires root
privilege to alter various /sys interface controls.  Currently this only
works for Intel P-State enabled x86 systems on Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice\-class class
specify ionice class (only on Linux). Can be idle (default), besteffort, be,
realtime, rt.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice\-level level
specify ionice level (only on Linux). For idle, 0 is the only possible
option. For besteffort or realtime values 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest
priority). See ionice(1) for more details.
.TP
.B \-\-job jobfile
run stressors using a jobfile.  The jobfile is essentially a file containing
stress-ng options (without the leading \-\-) with one option per line. Lines
may have comments with comment text proceeded by the # character. A simple
example is as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
run sequential   # run stressors sequentially
verbose          # verbose output
metrics-brief    # show metrics at end of run
timeout 60s      # stop each stressor after 60 seconds
#
# vm stressor options:
#
vm 2             # 2 vm stressors
vm-bytes 128M    # 128MB available memory
vm-keep          # keep vm mapping
vm-populate      # populate memory
#
# memcpy stressor options:
#
memcpy 5         # 5 memcpy stressors
.fi
.RE
.RS
.PP
The job file introduces the run command that specifies how to run the
stressors:
.PP
run sequential \- run stressors sequentially
.br
run parallel \- run stressors together in parallel
.PP
Note that 'run parallel' is the default.
.RE
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keep\-name
by default, stress\-ng will attempt to change the name of the stress
processes according to their functionality; this option disables this and
keeps the process names to be the name of the parent process, that is,
stress\-ng.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-brief
by default stress\-ng will report the name of the program, the message type
and the process id as a prefix to all output. The \-\-log\-brief option will
output messages without these fields to produce a less verbose output.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file filename
write messages to the specified log file.
.TP
.B \-\-maximize
overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the maximum
settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor
settings options if required.
.TP
.B \-\-metrics
output number of bogo operations in total performed by the stress processes.
Note that these are not a reliable metric of performance or throughput and
have not been designed to be used for benchmarking whatsoever. The metrics are
just a useful way to observe how a system behaves when under various kinds of
load.
.RS
.PP
The following columns of information are output:
.TS
expand;
lB lBw(\n[SM]n)
l l.
Column Heading	Explanation
T{
bogo ops
T}	T{
number of iterations of the stressor during the run. This is metric of
how much overall "work" has been achieved in bogo operations.
T}
T{
real time (secs)
T}	T{
average wall clock duration (in seconds) of the stressor. This is the total
wall clock time of all the instances of that particular stressor divided by
the number of these stressors being run.
T}
T{
usr time (secs)
T}	T{
total user time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the
stressor.
T}
T{
sys time (secs)
T}	T{
total system time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the
stressor.
T}
T{
bogo ops/s (real time)
T}	T{
total bogo operations per second based on wall clock run time. The wall clock
time reflects the apparent run time. The more processors one has on a system
the more the work load can be distributed onto these and hence the wall clock
time will reduce and the bogo ops rate will increase.  This is essentially
the "apparent" bogo ops rate of the system.
T}
T{
bogo ops/s (usr+sys time)
T}	T{
total bogo operations per second based on cumulative user and system time.
This is the real bogo ops rate of the system taking into consideration the
actual time execution time of the stressor across all the processors.
Generally this will decrease as one adds more concurrent stressors due to
contention on cache, memory, execution units, buses and I/O devices.
T}
.TE
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-metrics\-brief
enable metrics and only output metrics that are non-zero.
.TP
.B \-\-minimize
overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the minimum
settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor
settings options if required.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-madvise
from version 0.02.26 stress\-ng automatically calls madvise(2) with random
advise options before each mmap and munmap to stress the the vm subsystem a
little harder. The \-\-no\-advise option turns this default off.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-rand\-seed
Do not seed the stress-ng pseudo-random number generator with a quasi random
start seed, but instead seed it with constant values. This forces tests to
run each time using the same start conditions which can be useful when one
requires reproducible stress tests.
.TP
.B \-\-oomable
Do not respawn a stressor if it gets killed by the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer.
The default behaviour is to restart a new instance of a stressor if the kernel
OOM killer terminates the process. This option disables this default
behaviour.
.TP
.B \-\-page\-in
touch allocated pages that are not in core, forcing them to be paged back in.
This is a useful option to force all the allocated pages to be paged in when
using the bigheap, mmap and vm stressors.  It will severely degrade
performance when the memory in the system is less than the allocated buffer
sizes.  This uses mincore(2) to determine the pages that are not in core and
hence need touching to page them back in.
.TP
.B \-\-pathological
enable stressors that are known to hang systems.  Some stressors can quickly
consume resources in such a way that they can rapidly hang a system before
the kernel can OOM kill them. These stressors are not enabled by default,
this option enables them, but you probably don't want to do this. You have
been warned.
.TP
.B \-\-perf
measure processor and system activity using perf events. Linux only and
caveat emptor, according to perf_event_open(2): "Always double-check your
results! Various generalized events have had wrong values.".  Note that
with Linux 4.7 one needs to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities for this
option to work, or adjust  /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to below
2 to use this without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
do not show any output.
.TP
.B \-r N, \-\-random N
start N random stress workers. If N is 0, then the number of configured
processors is used for N.
.TP
.B \-\-sched scheduler
select the named scheduler (only on Linux). To see the list of available
schedulers use: stress\-ng \-\-sched which
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-prio prio
select the scheduler priority level (only on Linux). If the scheduler does
not support this then the default priority level of 0 is chosen.
.TP
.B \-\-sequential N
sequentially run all the stressors one by one for a default of 60 seconds. The
number of instances of each of the individual stressors to be started is N.  If
N is less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number
of instances.  If N is zero, then the number of CPUs in the system is used.
Use the \-\-timeout option to specify the duration to run each stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-stressors
output the names of the available stressors.
.TP
.B \-\-syslog
log output (except for verbose \-v messages) to the syslog.
.TP
.B \-\-taskset list
set CPU affinity based on the list of CPUs provided; stress-ng is bound to
just use these CPUs (Linux only). The CPUs to be used are specified by a
comma separated list of CPU (0 to N-1). One can specify a range of CPUs
using '-', for example: \-\-taskset 0,2-3,6,7-11
.TP
.B \-\-temp\-path path
specify a path for stress\-ng temporary directories and temporary files;
the default path is the current working directory.  This path must have
read and write access for the stress-ng stress processes.
.TP
.B \-\-thrash
This can only be used when running on Linux and with root privilege. This
option starts a background thrasher process that works through all the
processes on a system and tries to page as many pages in the processes
as possible.  This will cause considerable amount of thrashing of swap
on an over-committed system.
.TP
.B \-t N, \-\-timeout T
stop stress test after T seconds. One can also specify the units of time in
seconds, minutes, hours, days or years with the suffix s, m, h, d or y.
Note: A timeout of 0 will run stress-ng without any timeouts (run forever).
.TP
.B \--timestamp
add a timestamp in hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of a second to the
log output.
.TP
.B \-\-timer\-slack N
adjust the per process timer slack to N nanoseconds (Linux only). Increasing
the timer slack allows the kernel to coalesce timer events by adding some
fuzziness to timer expiration times and hence reduce wakeups.  Conversely,
decreasing the timer slack will increase wakeups.  A value of 0 for the
timer-slack will set the system default of 50,000 nanoseconds.
.TP
.B \-\-times
show the cumulative user and system times of all the child processes at the
end of the stress run.  The percentage of utilisation of available CPU time is
also calculated from the number of on-line CPUs in the system.
.TP
.B \-\-tz
collect temperatures from the available thermal zones on the machine (Linux
only).  Some devices may have one or more thermal zones, where as others may
have none.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
show all debug, warnings and normal information output.
.TP
.B \-\-verify
verify results when a test is run. This is not available on all tests. This
will sanity check the computations or memory contents from a test run and
report to stderr any unexpected failures.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
show version of stress-ng, version of toolchain used to build stress-ng
and system information.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-exclude list
specify a list of one or more stressors to exclude (that is, do not run them).
This is useful to exclude specific stressors when one selects many stressors
to run using the \-\-class option, \-\-sequential, \-\-all and \-\-random
options. Example, run the cpu class stressors concurrently and exclude the
numa and search stressors:
.IP
stress\-ng \-\-class cpu \-\-all 1 \-x numa,bsearch,hsearch,lsearch
.TP
.B \-Y, \-\-yaml filename
output gathered statistics to a YAML formatted file named 'filename'.
.br
.sp 2
.PP
.B Stressor specific options:
.TP
.B \-\-access N
start N workers that work through various settings of file mode bits
(read, write, execute) for the file owner and checks if the user permissions
of the file using access(2) and faccessat(2) are sane.
.TP
.B \-\-access\-ops N
stop access workers after N bogo access sanity checks.
.TP
.B \-\-affinity N
start N workers that rapidly change CPU affinity (only on Linux). Rapidly
switching CPU affinity can contribute to poor cache behaviour.
.TP
.B \-\-affinity\-ops N
stop affinity workers after N bogo affinity operations (only on Linux).
.TP
.B \-\-affinity\-rand
switch CPU affinity randomly rather than the default of sequentially.
.TP
.B \-\-af\-alg N
start N workers that exercise the AF_ALG socket domain by hashing and encrypting
various sized random messages. This exercises the SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384,
SHA512, MD4, MD5, RMD128, RMD160, RMD256, RMD320, WP256, WP384, WP512, TGR128,
TGR160, TGR192 hashes and the cbc(aes), lrw(aes), ofb(aes), xts(twofish),
xts(serpent), xts(cast6), xts(camellia), lrw(twofish), lrw(cast6), lrw(camellia),
salsa20 skcipers.
.TP
.B \-\-af\-alg\-ops N
stop af\-alg workers after N AF_ALG messages are hashed.
.TP
.B \-\-aio N
start N workers that issue multiple small asynchronous I/O writes and reads on
a relatively small temporary file using the POSIX aio interface.  This will
just hit the file system cache and soak up a lot of user and kernel time in
issuing and handling I/O requests.  By default, each worker process will
handle 16 concurrent I/O requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aio\-ops N
stop POSIX asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aio\-requests N
specify the number of POSIX asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue,
the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-aiol N
start N workers that issue multiple 4K random asynchronous I/O writes using
the Linux aio system calls io_setup(2), io_submit(2), io_getevents(2) and
io_destroy(2).  By default, each worker process will handle 16 concurrent I/O
requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aiol\-ops N
stop Linux asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aiol\-requests N
specify the number of Linux asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue,
the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-apparmor N
start N workers that exercise various parts of the AppArmor interface. Currently
one needs root permission to run this particular test. Only available
on Linux systems with AppArmor support and requires the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability.
.TP
.B \-\-apparmor-ops
stop the AppArmor workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-atomic N
start N workers that exercise various GCC __atomic_*() built in operations
on 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit integers that are shared among the N workers. This
stressor is only available for builds using GCC 4.7.4 or higher. The stressor
forces many front end cache stalls and cache references.
.TP
.B \-\-atomic\-ops N
stop the atomic workers after N bogo atomic operations.
.TP
.B \-\-bad\-altstack N
start N workers that create broken alternative signal stacks for SIGSEGV
handling that in turn create secondary SIGSEGVs. A variety of randonly
selected methods are used to create the stacks:
.RS
.IP a)
Unmapping the alternative signal stack, before triggering the signal handling.
.IP b)
Changing the alternative signal stack to just being read only, write only, execute only.
.IP c)
Using a NULL alternative signal stack.
.IP d)
Using the signal handler object as the alternative signal stack.
.IP e)
Unmapping the alternative signal stack during execution of the signal handler.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-bad\-altstack\-ops N
stop the bad alternative stack stressors after N SIGSEGV bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-B N, \-\-bigheap N
start N workers that grow their heaps by reallocating memory. If the out of
memory killer (OOM) on Linux kills the worker or the allocation fails then the
allocating process starts all over again.  Note that the OOM adjustment for the
worker is set so that the OOM killer will treat these workers as the first
candidate processes to kill.
.TP
.B \-\-bigheap\-ops N
stop the big heap workers after N bogo allocation operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-bigheap\-growth N
specify amount of memory to grow heap by per iteration. Size can be from 4K to
64MB. Default is 64K.
.TP
.B \-\-bind\-mount N
start N workers that repeatedly bind mount / to / inside a user namespace. This
can consume resources rapidly, forcing out of memory situations. Do not use this
stressor unless you want to risk hanging your machine.
.TP
.B \-\-bind\-mount\-ops N
stop after N bind mount bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-branch N
start N workers that randomly jump to 256 randomly selected locations and
hence exercise the CPU branch prediction logic.
.TP
.B \-\-branch\-ops N
stop the branch stressors after N jumps
.TP
.B \-\-brk N
start N workers that grow the data segment by one page at a time using multiple
brk(2) calls. Each successfully allocated new page is touched to ensure it is
resident in memory.  If an out of memory condition occurs then the test will
reset the data segment to the point before it started and repeat the data
segment resizing over again.  The process adjusts the out of memory setting so
that it may be killed by the out of memory (OOM) killer before other processes.
If it is killed by the OOM killer then it will be automatically re-started by
a monitoring parent process.
.TP
.B \-\-brk\-ops N
stop the brk workers after N bogo brk operations.
.TP
.B \-\-brk\-notouch
do not touch each newly allocated data segment page. This disables the default
of touching each newly allocated page and hence avoids the kernel from
necessarily backing the page with real physical memory.
.TP
.B \-\-bsearch N
start N workers that binary search a sorted array of 32 bit integers using
bsearch(3). By default, there are 65536 elements in the array.  This is a
useful method to exercise random access of memory and processor cache.
.TP
.B \-\-bsearch\-ops N
stop the bsearch worker after N bogo bsearch operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-bsearch\-size N
specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to bsearch. Size can
be from 1K to 4M.
.TP
.B \-C N, \-\-cache N
start N workers that perform random wide spread memory read and writes to
thrash the CPU cache.  The code does not intelligently determine the CPU cache
configuration and so it may be sub-optimal in producing hit-miss read/write
activity for some processors.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-fence
force write serialization on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op
for non-x86 architectures.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-flush
force flush cache on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op for
non-x86 architectures.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-level N
specify level of cache to exercise (1=L1 cache, 2=L2 cache, 3=L3/LLC cache (the default)).
If the cache hierarchy cannot be determined, built-in defaults will apply.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-no\-affinity
do not change processor affinity when
.B \-\-cache
is in effect.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-ops N
stop cache thrash workers after N bogo cache thrash operations.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-prefetch
force read prefetch on next read address on architectures that support
prefetching.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-ways N
specify the number of cache ways to exercise. This allows a subset of
the overall cache size to be exercised.
.TP
.B \-\-cap N
start N workers that read per process capabilities via calls to capget(2)
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-cap\-ops N
stop after N cap bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chdir N
start N workers that change directory between directories using chdir(2).
.TP
.B \-\-chdir\-ops N
stop after N chdir bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chdir\-dirs N
exercise chdir on N directories. The default is 8192 directories, this allows
64 to 65536 directories to be used instead.
.TP
.B \-\-chmod N
start N workers that change the file mode bits via chmod(2) and fchmod(2) on
the same file. The greater the value for N then the more contention on the
single file.  The stressor will work through all the combination of mode bits.
.TP
.B \-\-chmod\-ops N
stop after N chmod bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chown N
start N workers that exercise chown(2) on the same file. The greater the
value for N then the more contention on the single file.
.TP
.B \-\-chown\-ops N
stop the chown workers after N bogo chown(2) operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chroot N
start N workers that exercise chroot(2) on various valid and invalid
chroot paths. Only available on Linux systems and requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability.
.TP
.B \-\-chroot\-ops N
stop the chroot workers after N bogo chroot(2) operations.
.TP
.B \-\-clock N
start N workers exercising clocks and POSIX timers. For all known clock types
this will exercise clock_getres(2), clock_gettime(2) and clock_nanosleep(2).
For all known timers it will create a 50000ns timer and busy poll this until
it expires.  This stressor will cause frequent context switching.
.TP
.B \-\-clock\-ops N
stop clock stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-clone N
start N workers that create clones (via the clone(2) system call). This will
rapidly try to create a default of 8192 clones that immediately die and wait in
a zombie state until they are reaped.  Once the maximum number of clones is
reached (or clone fails because one has reached the maximum allowed) the oldest
clone thread is reaped and a new clone is then created in a first-in first-out
manner, and then repeated.  A random clone flag is selected for each clone to
try to exercise different clone operations.  The clone stressor is a Linux only
option.
.TP
.B \-\-clone\-ops N
stop clone stress workers after N bogo clone operations.
.TP
.B \-\-clone\-max N
try to create as many as N clone threads. This may not be reached if the system
limit is less than N.
.TP
.B \-\-close N
start N workers that try to force race conditions on closing opened file
descriptors.  These file descriptors have been opened in various ways to try
and exercise different kernel close handlers.
.TP
.B \-\-close\-ops N
stop close workers after N bogo close operations.
.TP
.B \-\-context N
start N workers that run three threads that use swapcontext(3) to implement the
thread-to-thread context switching. This exercises rapid process context saving
and restoring and is bandwidth limited by register and memory save and restore
rates.
.TP
.B \-\-context\-ops N
stop context workers after N bogo context switches.  In this stressor, 1 bogo
op is equivalent to 1000 swapcontext calls.
.TP
.B \-\-copy\-file N
start N stressors that copy a file using the Linux copy_file_range(2) system
call. 2MB chunks of data are copied from random locations from one file to
random locations to a destination file.  By default, the files are 256 MB in
size. Data is sync'd to the filesystem after each copy_file_range(2) call.
.TP
.B \-\-copy\-file\-ops N
stop after N copy_file_range() calls.
.TP
.B \-\-copy\-file\-bytes N
copy file size, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size as % of free
space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using
the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-c N, \-\-cpu N
start N workers exercising the CPU by sequentially working through all the
different CPU stress methods. Instead of exercising all the CPU stress methods,
one can specify a specific CPU stress method with the \-\-cpu\-method option.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-ops N
stop cpu stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-l P, \-\-cpu\-load P
load CPU with P percent loading for the CPU stress workers. 0 is effectively a
sleep (no load) and 100 is full loading.  The loading loop is broken into
compute time (load%) and sleep time (100% - load%). Accuracy depends on the
overall load of the processor and the responsiveness of the scheduler, so the
actual load may be different from the desired load.  Note that the number of
bogo CPU operations may not be linearly scaled with the load as some systems
employ CPU frequency scaling and so heavier loads produce an increased CPU
frequency and greater CPU bogo operations.

Note: This option only applies to the \-\-cpu stressor option and not to
all of the cpu class of stressors.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-load\-slice S
note \- this option is only useful when \-\-cpu\-load is less than 100%. The
CPU load is broken into multiple busy and idle cycles. Use this option to
specify the duration of a busy time slice.  A negative value for S specifies
the number of iterations to run before idling the CPU (e.g. -30 invokes 30
iterations of a CPU stress loop).  A zero value selects a random busy time
between 0 and 0.5 seconds.  A positive value for S specifies the number of
milliseconds to run before idling the CPU (e.g. 100 keeps the CPU busy for
0.1 seconds).  Specifying small values for S lends to small time slices and
smoother scheduling.  Setting \-\-cpu\-load as a relatively low value and
\-\-cpu\-load\-slice to be large will cycle the CPU between long idle and
busy cycles and exercise different CPU frequencies.  The thermal range of
the CPU is also cycled, so this is a good mechanism to exercise the scheduler,
frequency scaling and passive/active thermal cooling mechanisms.

Note: This option only applies to the \-\-cpu stressor option and not to
all of the cpu class of stressors.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-method method

.PP
Note that some of these methods try to exercise the CPU with computations found
in some real world use cases. However, the code has not been optimised on a
per-architecture basis, so may be a sub-optimal compared to hand-optimised code
used in some applications.  They do try to represent the typical instruction
mixes found in these use cases.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-online N
start N workers that put randomly selected CPUs offline and online. This Linux
only stressor requires root privilege to perform this action. By default the
first CPU (CPU 0) is never offlined as this has been found to be problematic
on some systems and can result in a shutdown.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-online\-all
The default is to never offline the first CPU.  This option will offline and
online all the CPUs include CPU 0. This may cause some systems to shutdown.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-online\-ops N
stop after offline/online operations.
.TP
.B \-\-crypt N
start N workers that encrypt a 16 character random password using crypt(3).
The password is encrypted using MD5, SHA-256 and SHA-512 encryption methods.
.TP
.B \-\-crypt\-ops N
stop after N bogo encryption operations.
.TP
.B \-\-cyclic N
start N workers that exercise the real time FIFO or Round Robin schedulers
with cyclic nanosecond sleeps. Normally one would just use 1 worker instance
with this stressor to get reliable statistics.  This stressor measures the
first 10 thousand latencies and calculates the mean, mode, minimum, maximum
latencies along with various latency percentiles for the just the first
cyclic stressor instance. One has to run this stressor with CAP_SYS_NICE
capability to enable the real time scheduling policies. The FIFO scheduling
policy is the default.
.TP
.B \-\-cyclic\-ops N
stop after N sleeps.
.TP
.B \-\-cyclic\-dist N
calculate and print a latency distribution with the interval of N nanoseconds.
This is helpful to see where the latencies are clustering.
.TP
.B \-\-cyclic\-method [ clock_ns | itimer | poll | posix_ns | pselect | usleep ]
specify the cyclic method to be used, the default is clock_ns. The available
cyclic methods are as follows:
.TS
expand;
lB2 lBw(\n[SZ]n)
l l.
Method	Description
clock_ns	T{
sleep for the specified time using the clock_nanosleep(2) high
resolution nanosleep and the CLOCK_REALTIME real time clock.

.TP
.B \-\-cyclic\-policy [ fifo | rr ]
specify the desired real time scheduling policy, ff (first-in, first-out)
or rr (round robin).
.TP
.B \-\-cyclic\-prio P
specify the scheduling priority P. Range from 1 (lowest) to 100 (highest).
.TP
.B \-\-cyclic\-sleep N
sleep for N nanoseconds per test cycle using clock_nanosleep(2) with the
CLOCK_REALTIME timer. Range from 1 to 1000000000 nanoseconds.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon N
start N workers that each create a daemon that dies immediately after creating
another daemon and so on. This effectively works through the process table with
short lived processes that do not have a parent and are waited for by init.
This puts pressure on init to do rapid child reaping.  The daemon processes
perform the usual mix of calls to turn into typical UNIX daemons, so this
artificially mimics very heavy daemon system stress.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon\-ops N
stop daemon workers after N daemons have been created.
.TP
.B \-\-dccp N
start N workers that send and receive data using the Datagram Congestion
Control Protocol (DCCP) (RFC4340). This involves a pair of client/server
processes performing rapid connect, send and receives and disconnects on
the local host.
.TP
.B \-\-dccp\-domain D
specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4 and ipv6
are supported.
.TP
.B \-\-dccp\-port P
start DCCP at port P. For N dccp worker processes, ports P to P - 1 are
used.
.TP
.B \-\-dccp\-ops N
stop dccp stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dccp\-opts [ send | sendmsg | sendmmsg ]
by default, messages are sent using send(2). This option allows one to specify
the sending method using send(2), sendmsg(2) or sendmmsg(2).  Note that
sendmmsg is only available for Linux systems that support this system call.
.TP
.B \-D N, \-\-dentry N
start N workers that create and remove directory entries.  This should create
file system meta data activity. The directory entry names are suffixed by a
gray-code encoded number to try to mix up the hashing of the namespace.
.TP
.B \-\-dentry\-ops N
stop denty thrash workers after N bogo dentry operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dentry\-order [ forward | reverse | stride | random ]
specify unlink order of dentries, can be one of forward, reverse, stride
or random.
By default, dentries are unlinked in random order.  The forward
order will unlink them from first to last, reverse order will unlink
them from last to first, stride order will unlink them by stepping
around order in a quasi-random pattern and random order will randomly
select one of forward, reverse or stride orders.
.TP
.B \-\-dentries N
create N dentries per dentry thrashing loop, default is 2048.
.TP
.B \-\-dev N
start N workers that exercise the /dev devices. Each worker runs 5
concurrent threads that perform open(2), fstat(2), lseek(2), poll(2),
fcntl(2), mmap(2), munmap(2), fsync(2) and close(2) on each device.
Note that watchdog devices are not exercised.
.TP
.B \-\-dev\-ops N
stop dev workers after N bogo device exercising operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dev\-shm N
start N workers that fallocate large files in /dev/shm and then mmap
these into memory and touch all the pages. This exercises pages being
moved to/from the buffer cache. Linux only.
.TP
.B \-\-dev\-shm\-ops N
stop after N bogo allocation and mmap /dev/shm operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dir N
start N workers that create and remove directories using mkdir and rmdir.
.TP
.B \-\-dir\-ops N
stop directory thrash workers after N bogo directory operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dir\-dirs N
exercise dir on N directories. The default is 8192 directories, this allows
64 to 65536 directories to be used instead.
.TP
.B \-\-dirdeep N
start N workers that create a depth-first tree of directories to a maximum
depth as limited by PATH_MAX or ENAMETOOLONG (which ever occurs first).
By default, each level of the tree contains one directory, but this can
be increased to a maximum of 10 sub-trees using the \-\-dirdeep\-dir option.
To stress inode creation, a symlink and a hardlink to a file at the root
of the tree is created in each level.
.TP
.B \-\-dirdeep\-ops N
stop directory depth workers after N bogo directory operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dirdeep\-dirs N
create N directories at each tree level. The default is just 1 but can be
increased to a maximum of 10 per level.
.TP
.B \-\-dirdeep\-inodes N
consume up to N inodes per dirdeep stressor while creating directories and
links. The value N can be the number of inodes or a percentage of the total
available free inodes on the filesystem being used.
.TP
.B \-\-dnotify N
start N workers performing file system activities such as making/deleting
files/directories, renaming files, etc. to stress exercise the various dnotify
events (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-dnotify\-ops N
stop inotify stress workers after N dnotify bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dup N
start N workers that perform dup(2) and then close(2) operations on /dev/zero.
The maximum opens at one time is system defined, so the test will run up to
this maximum, or 65536 open file descriptors, which ever comes first.
.TP
.B \-\-dup\-ops N
stop the dup stress workers after N bogo open operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dynlib N
start N workers that dynamically load and unload various shared libraries. This
exercises memory mapping and dynamic code loading and symbol lookups. See
dlopen(3) for more details of this mechanism.
.TP
.B \-\-dynlib\-ops N
stop workers after N bogo load/unload cycles.
.TP
.B \-\-efivar N
start N works that exercise the Linux /sys/firmware/efi/vars interface by
reading the EFI variables. This is a Linux only stress test for platforms
that support the EFI vars interface and requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability.
.TP
.B \-\-efivar-ops N
stop the efivar stressors after N EFI variable read operations.
.TP
.B \-\-enosys N
start N workers that exercise non-functional system call numbers. This calls
a wide range of system call numbers to see if it can break a system where these
are not wired up correctly.  It also keeps track of system calls that exist
(ones that don't return ENOSYS) so that it can focus on purely finding and
exercising non-functional system calls. This stressor exercises system calls
from 0 . .__NR_syscalls + 1024, random system calls within constrained in the
ranges of 0 to 2^8, 2^16, 2^24, 2^32, 2^40, 2^48, 2^56 and 2^64 bits,
high system call numbers and various other bit patterns to try to get wide good
coverage. To keep the environment clean, each system call being tested runs
in a child process with reduced capabilities.
.TP
.B \-\-enosys\-ops N
stop after N bogo enosys system call attempts
.TP
.B \-\-epoll N
start N workers that perform various related socket stress activity using
epoll_wait(2) to monitor and handle new connections. This involves
client/server processes performing rapid connect, send/receives and disconnects
on the local host.  Using epoll allows a large number of connections to be
efficiently handled, however, this can lead to the connection table filling up
and blocking further socket connections, hence impacting on the epoll bogo op
stats.  For ipv4 and ipv6 domains, multiple servers are spawned on multiple
ports. The epoll stressor is for Linux only.
.TP
.B \-\-epoll\-domain D
specify the domain to use, the default is unix (aka local). Currently ipv4,
ipv6 and unix are supported.
.TP
.B \-\-epoll\-port P
start at socket port P. For N epoll worker processes, ports P to (P * 4) - 1
are used for ipv4, ipv6 domains and ports P to P - 1 are used for the unix
domain.
.TP
.B \-\-epoll\-ops N
stop epoll workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-eventfd N
start N parent and child worker processes that read and write 8 byte event
messages between them via the eventfd mechanism (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-eventfd\-ops N
stop eventfd workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-exec N
start N workers continually forking children that exec stress-ng and then exit
almost immediately.
.TP
.B \-\-exec\-ops N
stop exec stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-exec\-max P
create P child processes that exec stress-ng and then wait for them to exit per
iteration. The default is just 1; higher values will create many temporary
zombie processes that are waiting to be reaped. One can potentially fill up the
process table using high values for \-\-exec\-max and \-\-exec.
.TP
.B \-F N, \-\-fallocate N
start N workers continually fallocating (preallocating file space) and
ftruncating (file truncating) temporary files.  If the file is larger than the
free space, fallocate will produce an ENOSPC error which is ignored by this
stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-fallocate\-bytes N
allocated file size, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size as % of free
space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using
the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-fallocate\-ops N
stop fallocate stress workers after N bogo fallocate operations.
.TP
.B \-\-fanotify N
start N workers performing file system activities such as creating, opening,
writing, reading and unlinking files to exercise the fanotify event monitoring
interface (Linux only). Each stressor runs a child process to generate file
events and a parent process to read file events using fanotify. Has to be run
with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
.TP
.B \-\-fanotify-ops N
stop fanotify stress workers after N bogo fanotify events.
.TP
.B \-\-fault N
start N workers that generates minor and major page faults.
.TP
.B \-\-fault\-ops N
stop the page fault workers after N bogo page fault operations.
.TP
.B \-\-fcntl N
start N workers that perform fcntl(2) calls with various commands.  The
exercised commands (if available) are: F_DUPFD, F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC, F_GETFD,
F_SETFD, F_GETFL, F_SETFL, F_GETOWN, F_SETOWN, F_GETOWN_EX, F_SETOWN_EX,
F_GETSIG, F_SETSIG, F_GETLK, F_SETLK, F_SETLKW, F_OFD_GETLK, F_OFD_SETLK
and F_OFD_SETLKW.
.TP
.B \-\-fcntl\-ops N
stop the fcntl workers after N bogo fcntl operations.
.TP
.B \-\-fiemap N
start N workers that each create a file with many randomly changing extents
and has 4 child processes per worker that gather the extent information using
the FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl(2).
.TP
.B \-\-fiemap\-ops N
stop after N fiemap bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-fiemap\-bytes N
specify the size of the fiemap'd file in bytes.  One can specify the size
as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes
and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.  Larger files will contain more
extents, causing more stress when gathering extent information.
.TP
.B \-\-fifo N
start N workers that exercise a named pipe by transmitting 64 bit integers.
.TP
.B \-\-fifo-ops N
stop fifo workers after N bogo pipe write operations.

.B \-\-fifo-readers N
for each worker, create N fifo reader workers that read
the named pipe using simple blocking reads.
.TP
.B \-\-file\-ioctl N
start N workers that exercise various file specific ioctl(2) calls. This will
attempt to use the FIONBIO, FIOQSIZE, FIGETBSZ, FIOCLEX, FIONCLEX, FIONBIO,
FIOASYNC, FIOQSIZE, FIFREEZE, FITHAW, FICLONE, FICLONERANGE, FIONREAD,
FIONWRITE and FS_IOC_RESVSP ioctls if these are defined.

start N workers that exercise file creation using various length filenames
containing a range of allowed filename characters.  This will try to see if
it can exceed the file system allowed filename length was well as test
various filename lengths between 1 and the maximum allowed by the file system.

default is just 1; higher values will create many temporary zombie processes
that are waiting to be reaped. One can potentially fill up the the process
table using high values for \-\-fork\-max and \-\-fork.
.TP
.B \-\-fp\-error N
start N workers that generate floating point exceptions. Computations are
performed to force and check for the FE_DIVBYZERO, FE_INEXACT, FE_INVALID,

.TP
.B \-\-full\-ops N
stop the stress full workers after N bogo I/O operations.
.TP
.B \-\-funccall N
start N workers that call functions of 1 through to 9 arguments. By default
functions with uint64_t arguments are called, however, this can be changed
using the \-\-funccall\-method option.
.TP

.B \-\-futex N
start N workers that rapidly exercise the futex system call. Each worker has
two processes, a futex waiter and a futex waker. The waiter waits with a very
small timeout to stress the timeout and rapid polled futex waiting. This is a
Linux specific stress option.
.TP
.B \-\-futex\-ops N
stop futex workers after N bogo successful futex wait operations.
.TP
.B \-\-get N
start N workers that call system calls that fetch data from the kernel,
currently these are: getpid, getppid, getcwd, getgid, getegid, getuid,
getgroups, getpgrp, getpgid, getpriority, getresgid, getresuid, getrlimit,
prlimit, getrusage, getsid, gettid, getcpu, gettimeofday, uname, adjtimex,

stop after N handle bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-d N, \-\-hdd N
start N workers continually writing, reading and removing temporary files. The
default mode is to stress test sequential writes and reads.  With
the \-\-aggressive option enabled without any \-\-hdd\-opts options the
hdd stressor will work through all the \-\-hdd\-opt options one by one to
cover a range of I/O options.
.TP

follows:
.TS
expand;
lB lBw(\n[SZ]n)
l l.
Option	Description
direct	T{
try to minimize cache effects of the I/O. File I/O writes are performed
directly from user space buffers and synchronous transfer is also attempted.
To guarantee synchronous I/O, also use the sync option.
T}
dsync	T{
ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware and file metadata
has been updated (using the O_DSYNC open flag). This is equivalent to each
write(2) being followed by a call to fdatasync(2). See also the fdatasync
option.
T}
fadv\-dontneed	T{
advise kernel to expect the data will not be accessed in the near future.
T}
fadv\-noreuse	T{
advise kernel to expect the data to be accessed only once.
T}
fadv\-normal	T{
advise kernel there are no explicit access pattern for the data. This is the
default advice assumption.
T}
fadv\-rnd	T{
advise kernel to expect random access patterns for the data.
T}
fadv\-seq	T{
advise kernel to expect sequential access patterns for the data.
T}
fadv\-willneed	T{
advise kernel to expect the data to be accessed in the near future.
T}
fsync	T{
flush all modified in-core data after each write to the output device using an
explicit fsync(2) call.
T}
fdatasync	T{
similar to fsync, but do not flush the modified metadata unless metadata is
required for later data reads to be handled correctly. This uses an explicit
fdatasync(2) call.
T}
iovec	T{
use readv/writev multiple buffer I/Os rather than read/write. Instead of 1
read/write operation, the buffer is broken into an iovec of 16 buffers.
T}
noatime	T{
do not update the file last access timestamp, this can reduce metadata writes.
T}
sync	T{
ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware (using the O_SYNC
open flag). This is equivalent to a each write(2) being followed by a call to
fsync(2). See also the fsync option.
T}
rd\-rnd	T{
read data randomly. By default, written data is not read back, however, this
option will force it to be read back randomly.
T}
rd\-seq	T{
read data sequentially. By default, written data is not read back, however,
this option will force it to be read back sequentially.
T}
syncfs	T{
write all buffered modifications of file metadata and data on the filesystem
that contains the hdd worker files.
T}
utimes	T{
force update of file timestamp which may increase metadata writes.
T}
wr\-rnd	T{
write data randomly. The wr\-seq option cannot be used at the same time.
T}
wr\-seq	T{
write data sequentially. This is the default if no write modes are specified.
T}
.TE
.RE
.PP
Note that some of these options are mutually exclusive, for example, there can
be only one method of writing or reading.  Also, fadvise flags may be mutually
exclusive, for example fadv-willneed cannot be used with fadv-dontneed.
.TP
.B \-\-hdd\-ops N
stop hdd stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-hdd\-write\-size N
specify size of each write in bytes. Size can be from 1 byte to 4MB.

.TP
.B \-\-hrtimers N
start N workers that exercise high resolution times at a high frequency. Each
stressor starts 32 processes that run with random timer intervals of 0..499999
nanoseconds. Running this stressor with appropriate privilege will run these
with the SCHED_RR policy.
.TP
.B \-\-hrtimers\-ops N
stop hrtimers stressors after N timer event bogo operations
.TP
.B \-\-hsearch N
start N workers that search a 80% full hash table using hsearch(3). By default,
there are 8192 elements inserted into the hash table.  This is a useful method
to exercise access of memory and processor cache.
.TP

stop the hsearch workers after N bogo hsearch operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-hsearch\-size N
specify the number of hash entries to be inserted into the hash table. Size can
be from 1K to 4M.
.TP
.B \-\-icache N
start N workers that stress the instruction cache by forcing instruction cache
reloads.  This is achieved by modifying an instruction cache line,  causing
the processor to reload it when we call a function in inside it. Currently
only verified and enabled for Intel x86 CPUs.
.TP
.B \-\-icache\-ops N
stop the icache workers after N bogo icache operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-icmp\-flood N
start N workers that flood localhost with randonly sized ICMP ping packets.
This stressor requires the CAP_NET_RAW capbility.
.TP
.B \-\-icmp\-flood\-ops N
stop icmp flood workers after N ICMP ping packets have been sent.
.TP
.B \-\-idle\-scan N
start N workers that scan the idle page bitmap across a range of physical
pages. This sets and checks for idle pages via the idle page tracking
interface /sys/kernel/mm/page_idle/bitmap.  This is for Linux only.
.TP
.B \-\-idle\-scan\-ops N
stop after N bogo page scan operations. Currently one bogo page scan
operation is equivalent to setting and checking 64 physical pages.
.TP
.B \-\-idle\-page N
start N workers that walks through every page exercising the Linux
/sys/kernel/mm/page_idle/bitmap interface. Requries CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
capability.
.TP
.B \-\-idle\-page\-ops N
stop after N bogo idle page operations.
.TP
.B \-\-inode-flags N
start N workers that exercise inode flags using the FS_IOC_GETFLAGS and
FS_IOC_SETFLAGS ioctl(2). This attempts to apply all the available inode
flags onto a directory and file even if the underlying file system may not
support these flags (errors are just ignored).  Each worker runs 4 threads
that exercise the flags on the same directory and file to try to force
races. This is a Linux only stressor, see ioctl_iflags(2) for more details.
.TP
.B \-\-inode-flags-ops N
stop the inode-flags workers after N ioctl flag setting attempts.
.TP
.B \-\-inotify N
start N workers performing file system activities such as making/deleting
files/directories, moving files, etc. to stress exercise the various inotify
events (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-inotify\-ops N
stop inotify stress workers after N inotify bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-i N, \-\-io N
start N workers continuously calling sync(2) to commit buffer cache to disk.
This can be used in conjunction with the \-\-hdd options.
.TP
.B \-\-io\-ops N
stop io stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-iomix N
start N workers that perform a mix of sequential, random and memory mapped
read/write operations as well as forced sync'ing and (if run as root)
cache dropping.  Multiple child processes are spawned to all share a single
file and perform different I/O operations on the same file.
.TP
.B \-\-iomix\-bytes N
write N bytes for each iomix worker process, the default is 1 GB. One can
specify the size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes,
KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-iomix\-ops N
stop iomix stress workers after N bogo iomix I/O operations.
.TP
.B \-\-ioport N
start N workers than perform bursts of 16 reads and 16 writes of ioport 0x80
(x86 Linux systems only).  I/O performed on x86 platforms on port 0x80 will
cause delays on the CPU performing the I/O.
.TP
.B \-\-ioport\-ops N
stop the ioport stressors after N bogo I/O operations
.TP
.B \-\-ioport\-opts [ in | out | inout ]
specify if port reads in, port read writes out or reads and writes are
to be performed.  The default is both in and out.
.TP
.B \-\-ioprio N
start N workers that exercise the ioprio_get(2) and ioprio_set(2) system calls
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-ioprio\-ops N
stop after N io priority bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-ipsec\-mb N
start N workers that perform cryptographic processing using the highly
optimized Intel Multi-Buffer Crypto for IPsec library. Depending on the
features available, SSE, AVX, AVX and AVX512 CPU features will be used
on data encrypted by SHA, DES, CMAC, CTR, HMAC MD5, HMAC SHA1 and
HMAC SHA512 cryptographic routines. This is only available for x86-64
modern Intel CPUs.
.TP
.B \-\-ipsec\-mb\-ops N
stop after N rounds of processing of data using the cryptographic
routines.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer N
start N workers that exercise the system interval timers. This sets up an
ITIMER_PROF itimer that generates a SIGPROF signal.  The default frequency for
the itimer is 1 MHz, however, the Linux kernel will set this to be no more that
the jiffy setting, hence high frequency SIGPROF signals are not normally
possible.  A busy loop spins on getitimer(2) calls to consume CPU and hence
decrement the itimer based on amount of time spent in CPU and system time.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer\-ops N
stop itimer stress workers after N bogo itimer SIGPROF signals.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer\-freq F
run itimer at F Hz; range from 1 to 1000000 Hz. Normally the highest frequency
is limited by the number of jiffy ticks per second, so running above 1000 Hz
is difficult to attain in practice.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer\-rand
select an interval timer frequency based around the interval timer
frequency +/- 12.5% random jitter. This tries to force more variability in
the timer interval to make the scheduling less predictable.
.TP
.B \-\-kcmp N
start N workers that use kcmp(2) to compare parent and child processes to
determine if they share kernel resources. Supported only for Linux and
requires CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.
.TP
.B \-\-kcmp\-ops N
stop kcmp workers after N bogo kcmp operations.
.TP
.B \-\-key N
start N workers that create and manipulate keys using add_key(2) and
ketctl(2). As many keys are created as the per user limit allows and then the
following keyctl commands are exercised on each key: KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT,
KEYCTL_DESCRIBE, KEYCTL_UPDATE, KEYCTL_READ, KEYCTL_CLEAR and
KEYCTL_INVALIDATE.
.TP
.B \-\-key\-ops N
stop key workers after N bogo key operations.
.TP
.B \-\-kill N
start N workers sending SIGUSR1 kill signals to a SIG_IGN signal handler. Most
of the process time will end up in kernel space.
.TP
.B \-\-kill\-ops N
stop kill workers after N bogo kill operations.
.TP
.B \-\-klog N
start N workers exercising the kernel syslog(2) system call.  This will
attempt to read the kernel log with various sized read buffers. Linux only.
.TP
.B \-\-klog\-ops N
stop klog workers after N syslog operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lease N
start N workers locking, unlocking and breaking leases via the fcntl(2)
F_SETLEASE operation. The parent processes continually lock and unlock a lease
on a file while a user selectable number of child processes open the file with
a non-blocking open to generate SIGIO lease breaking notifications to the
parent.  This stressor is only available if F_SETLEASE, F_WRLCK and F_UNLCK
support is provided by fcntl(2).
.TP
.B \-\-lease\-ops N
stop lease workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lease\-breakers N
start N lease breaker child processes per lease worker.  Normally one child is
plenty to force many SIGIO lease breaking notification signals to the parent,
however, this option allows one to specify more child processes if required.
.TP
.B \-\-link N
start N workers creating and removing hardlinks.
.TP
.B \-\-link\-ops N
stop link stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lockbus N
start N workers that rapidly lock and increment 64 bytes of randomly chosen
memory from a 16MB mmap'd region (Intel x86 and ARM CPUs only).  This will
cause cacheline misses and stalling of CPUs.
.TP
.B \-\-lockbus-ops N
stop lockbus workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-locka N
start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the
POSIX advisory locking mechanism (see fcntl(2), F_SETLK, F_GETLK). Each
worker creates a 1024 KB file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024
concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024
concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.
.TP
.B \-\-locka\-ops N
stop locka workers after N bogo locka operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lockf N
start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the
POSIX lockf(3) locking mechanism. Each worker creates a 64 KB file and
attempts to hold a maximum of 1024 concurrent locks with a child process
that also tries to hold 1024 concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in
a first-in, first-out basis.
.TP
.B \-\-lockf\-ops N
stop lockf workers after N bogo lockf operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lockf\-nonblock
instead of using blocking F_LOCK lockf(3) commands, use non-blocking F_TLOCK
commands and re-try if the lock failed.  This creates extra system call
overhead and CPU utilisation as the number of lockf workers increases and
should increase locking contention.
.TP
.B \-\-lockofd N
start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the
Linux open file description locks (see fcntl(2), F_OFD_SETLK, F_OFD_GETLK).
Each worker creates a 1024 KB file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024
concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024
concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.
.TP
.B \-\-lockofd\-ops N
stop lockofd workers after N bogo lockofd operations.
.TP
.B \-\-longjmp N
start N workers that exercise setjmp(3)/longjmp(3) by rapid looping on
longjmp calls.
.TP
.B \-\-longjmp-ops N
stop longjmp stress workers after N bogo longjmp operations (1 bogo op is 1000
longjmp calls).
.TP
.B \-\-loop N
start N workers that exercise the loopback control device. This creates 2MB
loopback devices, expands them to 4MB, performs some loopback status information
get and set operations and then destoys them. Linux only and requires
CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.
.TP
.B \-\-loop\-ops N
stop after N bogo loopback creation/deletion operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lsearch N
start N workers that linear search a unsorted array of 32 bit integers using
lsearch(3). By default, there are 8192 elements in the array.  This is a
useful method to exercise sequential access of memory and processor cache.
.TP
.B \-\-lsearch\-ops N
stop the lsearch workers after N bogo lsearch operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-lsearch\-size N
specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to lsearch. Size can
be from 1K to 4M.
.TP
.B \-\-madvise N
start N workers that apply random madvise(2) advise settings on pages of
a 4MB file backed shared memory mapping.
.TP
.B \-\-madvise\-ops N
stop madvise stressors after N bogo madvise operations.
.TP
.B \-\-malloc N
start N workers continuously calling malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3) and
free(3). By default, up to 65536 allocations can be active at any point, but
this can be altered with the \-\-malloc\-max option.  Allocation, reallocation
and freeing are chosen at random; 50% of the time memory is allocation (via
malloc, calloc or realloc) and 50% of the time allocations are free'd.
Allocation sizes are also random, with the maximum allocation size controlled
by the \-\-malloc\-bytes option, the default size being 64K.  The worker is
re-started if it is killed by the out of memory (OOM) killer.
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-bytes N
maximum per allocation/reallocation size. Allocations are randomly selected
from 1 to N bytes. One can specify the size as % of total available memory
or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or
g.  Large allocation sizes cause the memory allocator to use mmap(2) rather
than expanding the heap using brk(2).
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-max N
maximum number of active allocations allowed. Allocations are chosen at random
and placed in an allocation slot. Because about 50%/50% split between
allocation and freeing, typically half of the allocation slots are in use at
any one time.
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-ops N
stop after N malloc bogo operations. One bogo operations relates to a
successful malloc(3), calloc(3) or realloc(3).
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-thresh N
specify the threshold where malloc uses mmap(2) instead of sbrk(2) to allocate
more memory. This is only available on systems that provide the GNU C
mallopt(3) tuning function.
.TP
.B \-\-matrix N
start N workers that perform various matrix operations on floating point
values. Testing on 64 bit x86 hardware shows that this provides a good
mix of memory, cache and floating point operations and is an excellent way
to make a CPU run hot.

By default, this will exercise all the matrix stress methods one by
one.  One can specify a specific matrix stress method with the
\-\-matrix\-method option.
.TP
.B \-\-matrix\-ops N
stop matrix stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP

start N workers that produce memory contention read/write patterns. Each
stressor runs with 5 threads that read and write to two different mappings
of the same underlying physical page. Various caching operations are also
exercised to cause sub-optimal memory access patterns.  The threads also
randomly change CPU affinity to exercise CPU and memory migration stress.

start N workers that walk through all of memory 1 page at a time checking of
the page mapped and also is resident in memory using mincore(2).
.TP
.B \-\-mincore\-ops N
stop after N mincore bogo operations. One mincore bogo op is equivalent to a
1000 mincore(2) calls.
.TE
.B \-\-mincore\-random
instead of walking through pages sequentially, select pages at random. The
chosen address is iterated over by shifting it right one place and checked by
mincore until the address is less or equal to the page size.

start N workers that create and remove fifos, empty files and named sockets
using mknod and unlink.
.TP
.B \-\-mknod\-ops N
stop directory thrash workers after N bogo mknod operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mlock N
start N workers that lock and unlock memory mapped pages using mlock(2),
munlock(2), mlockall(2) and munlockall(2). This is achieved by the mapping of
three contiguous pages and then locking the second page, hence ensuring
non-contiguous pages are locked . This is then repeated until the maximum
allowed mlocks or a maximum of 262144 mappings are made.  Next, all future
mappings are mlocked and the worker attempts to map 262144 pages, then all
pages are munlocked and the pages are unmapped.
.TP
.B \-\-mlock\-ops N
stop after N mlock bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mlockmany N
start N workers that fork off up to 1024 child processes in total;
each child will attempt to anonymously mmap and mlock the maximum allowed
mlockable memory size.  The stress test attempts to avoid swapping by
tracking low memory and swap allocations (but some swapping may occur). Once
either the maximum number of child process is reached or all mlockable in-core
memory is locked then child processes are killed and the stress test is
repeated.
.TP
.B \-\-mlockmany\-ops N
stop after N mlockmany (mmap and mlock) operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap N
start N workers continuously calling mmap(2)/munmap(2).  The initial mapping
is a large chunk (size specified by \-\-mmap\-bytes) followed by pseudo-random
4K unmappings, then pseudo-random 4K mappings, and then linear 4K unmappings.
Note that this can cause systems to trip the kernel OOM killer on Linux
systems if not enough physical memory and swap is not available.  The
MAP_POPULATE option is used to populate pages into memory on systems that
support this.  By default, anonymous mappings are used, however, the
\-\-mmap\-file and \-\-mmap\-async options allow one to perform file based
mappings if desired.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-ops N
stop mmap stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-async
enable file based memory mapping and use asynchronous msync'ing on each page,
see \-\-mmap\-file.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-bytes N
allocate N bytes per mmap stress worker, the default is 256MB. One can specify
the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes
and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-file
enable file based memory mapping and by default use synchronous msync'ing on
each page.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-mprotect
change protection settings on each page of memory.  Each time a page or a
group of pages are mapped or remapped then this option will make the pages
read-only, write-only, exec-only, and read-write.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapaddr N
start N workers that memory map pages at a random memory location that is
not already mapped.  On 64 bit machines the random address is randomly
chosen 32 bit or 64 bit address. If the mapping works a second page is
memory mapped from the first mapped address. The stressor exercises
mmap/munmap, mincore and segfault handling.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapaddr\-ops N
stop after N random address mmap bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapfork N
start N workers that each fork off 32 child processes, each of which tries to
allocate some of the free memory left in the system (and trying to avoid
any swapping).  The child processes then hint that the allocation will be
needed with madvise(2) and then memset it to zero and hint that it is no longer
needed with madvise before exiting.  This produces significant amounts of VM
activity, a lot of cache misses and with minimal swapping.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapfork\-ops N
stop after N mmapfork bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapfixed N
start N workers that perform fixed address allocations from the top virtual
address down to 128K.  The allocated sizes are from 1 page to 8 pages and
various random mmap flags are used MAP_SHARED/MAP_PRIVATE, MAP_LOCKED,
MAP_NORESERVE, MAP_POPULATE. If successfully map'd then the allocation
is remap'd to an address that is several pages higher in memory. Mappings
and remappings are madvised with random madvise options to further exercise
the mappings.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapfixed\-ops N
stop after N mmapfixed memory mapping bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapmany N
start N workers that attempt to create the maximum allowed per-process memory
mappings. This is achieved by mapping 3 contiguous pages and then unmapping the
middle page hence splitting the mapping into two. This is then repeated until
the maximum allowed mappings or a maximum of 262144 mappings are made.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapmany\-ops N
stop after N mmapmany bogo operations
.TP
.B \-\-mq N

messages using POSIX message queues. (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-mq\-ops N
stop after N bogo POSIX message send operations completed.
.TP
.B \-\-mq\-size N
specify size of POSIX message queue. The default size is 10 messages and most
Linux systems this is the maximum allowed size for normal users. If the given
size is greater than the allowed message queue size then a warning is issued
and the maximum allowed size is used instead.
.TP
.B \-\-mremap N
start N workers continuously calling mmap(2), mremap(2) and munmap(2).  The
initial anonymous mapping is a large chunk (size specified by
\-\-mremap\-bytes) and then iteratively halved in size by remapping all the
way down to a page size and then back up to the original size.  This worker
is only available for Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-mremap\-ops N
stop mremap stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mremap\-bytes N

suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-msg N
start N sender and receiver processes that continually send and receive
messages using System V message IPC.
.TP
.B \-\-msg\-ops N
stop after N bogo message send operations completed.
.TP
.B \-\-msg\-types N
select the quality of message types (mtype) to use. By default, msgsnd sends
messages with a mtype of 1, this option allows one to send messages types
in the range 1..N to exercise the message queue receive ordering. This will
also impact throughput performance.
.TP
.B \-\-msync N
start N stressors that msync data from a file backed memory mapping from
memory back to the file and msync modified data from the file back to the
mapped memory. This exercises the msync(2) MS_SYNC and MS_INVALIDATE sync
operations.
.TP
.B \-\-msync\-ops N
stop after N msync bogo operations completed.

are as follows: SIOCGIFCONF, SIOCGIFINDEX, SIOCGIFNAME, SIOCGIFFLAGS,
SIOCGIFADDR, SIOCGIFNETMASK, SIOCGIFMETRIC, SIOCGIFMTU, SIOCGIFHWADDR,
SIOCGIFMAP and SIOCGIFTXQLEN. See netdevice(7) for more details of these
ioctl commands.

.TP
.B \-\-netlink\-proc N
start N workers that spawn child processes and monitor fork/exec/exit
process events via the proc netlink connector. Each event received is counted
as a bogo op. This stressor can only be run on Linux and requires
CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.
.TP
.B \-\-netlink\-proc\-ops N
stop the proc netlink connector stressors after N bogo ops.

iteration forks off a child process that runs through the all the nice levels
running a busy loop for 0.1 seconds per level and then exits.
.TP
.B \-\-nice\-ops N
stop after N nice bogo nice loops
.TP
.B \-\-nop N
start N workers that consume cpu cycles issuing no-op instructions. This
stressor is available if the assembler supports the "nop" instruction.
.TP
.B \-\-nop\-ops N
stop nop workers after N no-op bogo operations. Each bogo-operation is
equivalent to 256 loops of 256 no-op instructions.

.B \-\-null\-ops N
stop null stress workers after N /dev/null bogo write operations.
.TP
.B \-\-numa N
start N workers that migrate stressors and a 4MB memory mapped buffer around
all the available NUMA nodes.  This uses migrate_pages(2) to move the stressors
and mbind(2) and move_pages(2) to move the pages of the mapped buffer. After
each move, the buffer is written to force activity over the bus which results
cache misses.  This test will only run on hardware with NUMA enabled and more
than 1 NUMA node.
.TP
.B \-\-numa\-ops N
stop NUMA stress workers after N bogo NUMA operations.
.TP
.B \-\-oom\-pipe N
start N workers that create as many pipes as allowed and exercise expanding
and shrinking the pipes from the largest pipe size down to a page size. Data
is written into the pipes and read out again to fill the pipe buffers. With
the \-\-aggressive mode enabled the data is not read out when the pipes are
shrunk, causing the kernel to OOM processes aggressively.  Running many
instances of this stressor will force kernel to OOM processes due to the
many large pipe buffer allocations.
.TP
.B \-\-oom\-pipe\-ops N
stop after N bogo pipe expand/shrink operations.
.TP
.B \-\-opcode N
start N workers that fork off children that execute randomly generated
executable code.  This will generate issues such as illegal instructions,
bus errors, segmentation faults, traps, floating point errors that are
handled gracefully by the stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-opcode\-ops N
stop after N attempts to execute illegal code.
.TP
.B \-\-opcode\-method [ inc | mixed | random | text ]

.TP
.B \-o N, \-\-open N
start N workers that perform open(2) and then close(2) operations on

run up to this maximum, or 65536 open file descriptors, which ever comes first.
.TP
.B \-\-open\-ops N

the physical page and page count of a virtual mapped page and a page that is
shared among all the stressors. Linux only and requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capabilities.
.TP
.B \-\-physpage\-ops N
stop physpage stress workers after N bogo physical address lookups.

stopped, restarted and killed using the pidfd_send_signal system call.
.TP
.B \-\-pidfd\-ops N
stop pidfd stress workers after N child processes have been created, tested
and killed with pidfd_send_signal.
.TP
.B \-p N, \-\-pipe N
start N workers that perform large pipe writes and reads to exercise pipe I/O.
This exercises memory write and reads as well as context switching.  Each
worker has two processes, a reader and a writer.
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-ops N
stop pipe stress workers after N bogo pipe write operations.
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-data\-size N
specifies the size in bytes of each write to the pipe (range from 4 bytes
to 4096 bytes). Setting a small data size will cause more writes to be
buffered in the pipe, hence reducing the context switch rate between the
pipe writer and pipe reader processes. Default size is the page size.
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-size N
specifies the size of the pipe in bytes (for systems that support the
F_SETPIPE_SZ fcntl() command). Setting a small pipe size will cause the pipe
to fill and block more frequently, hence increasing the context switch rate
between the pipe writer and the pipe reader processes. Default size is 512
bytes.
.TP
.B \-\-pkey N
start N workers that change memory protection using a protection key (pkey) and
the pkey_mprotect call (Linux only). This will try to allocate a pkey and
use this for the page protection, however, if this fails then the special
pkey -1 will be used (and the kernel will use the normal mprotect mechanism
instead).  Various page protection mixes of read/write/exec/none will
be cycled through on randomly chosen pre-allocated pages.
.TP
.B \-\-pkey\-ops N
stop after N pkey_mprotect page protection cycles.
.TP
.B \-P N, \-\-poll N

.TP
.B \-\-poll\-ops N
stop poll stress workers after N bogo poll operations.
.TP
.B \-\-prctl N
start N workers that exercise the majority of the prctl(2) system call
options. Each batch of prctl calls is performed inside a new child process
to ensure the limit of prctl is contained inside a new process every time.
Some prctl options are architecture specific, however, this stressor will
exercise these even if they are not implemented.
.TP
.B \-\-prctl\-ops N
stop prctl workers after N batches of prctl calls
.TP
.B \-\-procfs N
start N workers that read files from /proc and recursively read files from
/proc/self (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-procfs\-ops N
stop procfs reading after N bogo read operations. Note, since the number of
entries may vary between kernels, this bogo ops metric is probably very
misleading.
.TP
.B \-\-pthread N
start N workers that iteratively creates and terminates multiple pthreads
(the default is 1024 pthreads per worker). In each iteration, each newly
created pthread waits until the worker has created all the pthreads and then
they all terminate together.
.TP
.B \-\-pthread\-ops N
stop pthread workers after N bogo pthread create operations.
.TP
.B \-\-pthread\-max N
create N pthreads per worker. If the product of the number of pthreads by the

IO reads. The device (with minor number 0) that stores the current working
directory is the raw device to be read by the stressor.  The read size is
exactly the size of the underlying device block size.  By default, this
stressor will exercise all the of the rawdev methods (see the

revio stressor will work through all the \-\-revio\-opt options one by one to
cover a range of I/O options.
.TP
.B \-\-revio\-bytes N
write N bytes for each revio process, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the
size as % of free space on the file system or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes
and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-revio\-opts list
specify various stress test options as a comma separated list. Options are the
same as \-\-hdd\-opts but without the iovec option.

start N workers that exceed CPU and file size resource imits, generating
SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ signals.
.TP
.B \-\-rlimit\-ops N
stop after N bogo resource limited SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ signals have been caught.
.TP
.B \-\-rmap N
start N workers that exercise the VM reverse-mapping. This creates 16 processes
per worker that write/read multiple file-backed memory mappings. There are 64
lots of 4 page mappings made onto the file, with each mapping overlapping the
previous by 3 pages and at least 1 page of non-mapped memory between each
of the mappings. Data is synchronously msync'd to the file 1 in every
256 iterations in a random manner.
.TP
.B \-\-rmap\-ops N
stop after N bogo rmap memory writes/reads.
.TP
.B \-\-rtc N
start N workers that exercise the real time clock (RTC) interfaces via /dev/rtc
and /sys/class/rtc/rtc0. No destructive writes (modifications) are performed on
the RTC. This is a Linux only stressor.

stop after N bogo RTC interface accesses.
.TP
.B \-\-schedpolicy N
start N workers that work set the worker to various available scheduling
policies out of SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_BATCH, SCHED_IDLE, SCHED_FIFO and

is selected between the minimum and maximum scheduling priority settings.
.TP
.B \-\-schedpolicy\-ops N
stop after N bogo scheduling policy changes.
.TP
.B \-\-sctp N
start N workers that perform network sctp stress activity using the Stream
Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).  This involves client/server processes
performing rapid connect, send/receives and disconnects on the local host.

are supported.
.TP
.B \-\-sctp\-ops N
stop sctp workers after N bogo operations.

are used for ipv4, ipv6 domains and ports P to P - 1 are used for the unix
domain.
.TP
.B \-\-seal N
start N workers that exercise the fcntl(2) SEAL commands on a small anonymous
file created using memfd_create(2).  After each SEAL command is issued the
stressor also sanity checks if the seal operation has sealed the file correctly.
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-seal\-ops N
stop after N bogo seal operations.
.TP
.B \-\-seccomp N
start N workers that exercise Secure Computing system call filtering. Each
worker creates child processes that write a short message to /dev/null and then
exits. 2% of the child processes have a seccomp filter that disallows
the write system call and hence it is killed by seccomp with a SIGSYS.  Note
that this stressor can generate many audit log messages each time the child is
killed.  Requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.
.TP
.B \-\-seccomp-ops N
stop seccomp stress workers after N seccomp filter tests.
.TP
.B \-\-seek N
start N workers that randomly seeks and performs 512 byte read/write I/O
operations on a file. The default file size is 16 GB.

punch randomly located 8K holes into the file to cause more extents to force
a more demanding seek stressor, (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-seek\-size N
specify the size of the file in bytes. Small file sizes allow the I/O to occur
in the cache, causing greater CPU load. Large file sizes force more I/O
operations to drive causing more wait time and more I/O on the drive. One can
specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix
b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-sem N
start N workers that perform POSIX semaphore wait and post operations. By
default, a parent and 4 children are started per worker to provide some
contention on the semaphore. This stresses fast semaphore operations and
produces rapid context switching.

stop after N POSIX shared memory create and destroy bogo operations are
complete.
.TP
.B \-\-shm\-bytes N

specify the number of shared memory segments to be created.
.TP
.B \-\-sigfd N
start N workers that generate SIGRT signals and are handled by reads by a child
process using a file descriptor set up using signalfd(2).  (Linux only). This
will generate a heavy context switch load when all CPUs are fully loaded.

stop sigfd workers after N bogo SIGUSR1 signals are sent.
.TP
.B \-\-sigfpe N
start N workers that rapidly cause division by zero SIGFPE faults.
.TP

start N workers that read data from a child process via a pipe and generate
SIGIO signals. This exercises asynchronous I/O via SIGIO.
.TP
.B \-\-sigio\-ops N
stop sigio stress workers after handling N SIGIO signals.
.TP
.B \-\-sigpending N
start N workers that check if SIGUSR1 signals are pending. This stressor masks
SIGUSR1, generates a SIGUSR1 signal and uses sigpending(2) to see if the signal
is pending. Then it unmasks the signal and checks if the signal is no longer
pending.
.TP
.B \-\-sigpending-ops N
stop sigpending stress workers after N bogo sigpending pending/unpending checks.
.TP
.B \-\-sigpipe N
start N workers that repeatedly spawn off child process that exits before a
parent can complete a pipe write, causing a SIGPIPE signal.  The child
process is either spawned using clone(2) if it is available or use the slower
fork(2) instead.

.TP
.B \-\-sigsegv N
start N workers that rapidly create and catch segmentation faults.
.TP

stop sigsegv stress workers after N bogo segmentation faults.
.TP
.B \-\-sigsuspend N
start N workers that each spawn off 4 child processes that wait for a SIGUSR1
signal from the parent using sigsuspend(2). The parent sends SIGUSR1 signals
to each child in rapid succession.  Each sigsuspend wakeup is counted as one
bogo operation.

.B \-\-sigq\-ops N
stop sigq stress workers after N bogo signal send operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sigrt N
start N workers that each create child processes to handle SIGRTMIN to
SIGRMAX real time signals. The parent sends each child process a RT signal
via siqueue(2) and the child process waits for this via sigwaitinfo(2).
When the child receives the signal it then sends a RT signal to one of the
other child processes also via sigqueue(2).
.TP
.B \-\-sigrt\-ops N
stop sigrt stress workers after N bogo sigqueue signal send operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sleep N
start N workers that spawn off multiple threads that each perform multiple
sleeps of ranges 1us to 0.1s.  This creates multiple context switches and
timer interrupts.
.TP
.B \-\-sleep\-ops N
stop after N sleep bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sleep\-max P
start P threads per worker. The default is 1024, the maximum allowed is
30000.
.TP
.B \-S N, \-\-sock N
start N workers that perform various socket stress activity. This involves a
pair of client/server processes performing rapid connect, send and receives
and disconnects on the local host.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-domain D
specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4, ipv6 and unix
are supported.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-nodelay
This disables the TCP Nagle algorithm, so data segments are always sent
as soon as possible.  This stops data from being buffered before being
transmitted, hence resulting in poorer network utilisation and more context
switches between the sender and receiver.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-port P
start at socket port P. For N socket worker processes, ports P to P - 1 are
used.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-ops N
stop socket stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-opts [ send | sendmsg | sendmmsg ]
by default, messages are sent using send(2). This option allows one to specify
the sending method using send(2), sendmsg(2) or sendmmsg(2).  Note that
sendmmsg is only available for Linux systems that support this system call.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-type [ stream | seqpacket ]
specify the socket type to use. The default type is stream. seqpacket currently
only works for the unix socket domain.
.TP
.B \-\-sockdiag N
start N workers that exercise the Linux sock_diag netlink socket diagnostics
(Linux only).  This currently requests diagnostics using UDIAG_SHOW_NAME,
UDIAG_SHOW_VFS, UDIAG_SHOW_PEER, UDIAG_SHOW_ICONS, UDIAG_SHOW_RQLEN and
UDIAG_SHOW_MEMINFO for the AF_UNIX family of socket connections.
.TP
.B \-\-sockdiag\-ops N
stop after receiving N sock_diag diagnostic messages.
.TP
.B \-\-sockfd N
start N workers that pass file descriptors over a UNIX domain socket using the
CMSG(3) ancillary data mechanism. For each worker, pair of client/server
processes are created, the server opens as many file descriptors on /dev/null
as possible and passing these over the socket to a client that reads these from
the CMSG data and immediately closes the files.
.TP
.B \-\-sockfd\-ops N
stop sockfd stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sockfd\-port P
start at socket port P. For N socket worker processes, ports P to P - 1 are
used.
.TP
.B \-\-sockpair N
start N workers that perform socket pair I/O read/writes. This involves a pair
of client/server processes performing randomly sized socket I/O operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sockpair\-ops N
stop socket pair stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-softlockup N
start N workers that flip between with the "real-time" SCHED_FIO and SCHED_RR
scheduling policies at the highest priority to force softlockups. This can
only be run with CAP_SYS_NICE capability and for best results the number of
stressors should be at least the number of online CPUs. Once running, this is
practically impossible to stop and it will force softlockup issues and may
trigger watchdog timeout reboots.
.TP
.B \-\-softlockup\-ops N
stop softlockup stress workers after N bogo scheduler policy changes.
.TP
.B \-\-spawn N
start N workers continually spawn children using posix_spawn(3) that exec
stress-ng and then exit almost immediately. Currently Linux only.

.TP
.B \-\-splice-bytes N
transfer N bytes per splice call, the default is 64K. One can specify the size
as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes
using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-stack N
start N workers that rapidly cause and catch stack overflows by use of
large recursive stack allocations.  Much like the brk stressor, this can eat
up pages rapidly and may trigger the kernel OOM killer on the process,
however, the killed stressor is respawned again by a monitoring parent
process.
.TP
.B \-\-stack\-fill
the default action is to touch the lowest page on each stack allocation. This
option touches all the pages by filling the new stack allocation with zeros
which forces physical pages to be allocated and hence is more aggressive.
.TP
.B \-\-stack\-ops N
stop stack stress workers after N bogo stack overflows.
.TP
.B \-\-stackmmap N
start N workers that use a 2MB stack that is memory mapped onto a temporary
file. A recursive function works down the stack and flushes dirty stack pages
back to the memory mapped file using msync(2) until the end of the stack is
reached (stack overflow). This exercises dirty page and stack exception handling.
.TP
.B \-\-stackmmap\-ops N
stop workers after N stack overflows have occurred.
.TP
.B \-\-str N
start N workers that exercise various libc string functions on random strings.
.TP
.B \-\-str-method strfunc
select a specific libc string function to stress. Available string functions to
stress are: all, index, rindex, strcasecmp, strcat, strchr, strcoll, strcmp,
strcpy, strlen, strncasecmp, strncat, strncmp, strrchr and strxfrm.  See
string(3) for more information on these string functions.  The 'all' method is
the default and will exercise all the string methods.
.TP
.B \-\-str-ops N
stop after N bogo string operations.
.TP
.B \-\-stream N
start N workers exercising a memory bandwidth stressor loosely based on the
STREAM "Sustainable Memory Bandwidth in High Performance Computers" benchmarking
tool by John D. McCalpin, Ph.D.  This stressor allocates buffers that are at
least 4 times the size of the CPU L2 cache and continually performs rounds of
following computations on large arrays of double precision floating point numbers:
.TS
expand;
lB2 lBw(\n[SQ]n)
l l.
Operation	Description
copy	T{
c[i] = a[i]
T}
scale	T{
b[i] = scalar * c[i]
T}
add	T{
c[i] = a[i] + b[i]
T}
triad	T{
a[i] = b[i] + (c[i] * scalar)
T}
.TE
.RS
.PP
Since this is loosely based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code,
DO NOT submit results based on this as it is intended to in stress-ng just
to stress memory and compute and NOT intended for STREAM accurate
tuned or non-tuned benchmarking whatsoever.  Use the official STREAM
benchmarking tool if you desire accurate and standardised STREAM benchmarks.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-stream\-ops N
stop after N stream bogo operations, where a bogo operation is one round
of copy, scale, add and triad operations.
.TP
.B \-\-stream\-index N
specify number of stream indices used to index into the data arrays a, b and
c.  This adds indirection into the data lookup by using randomly shuffled
indexing into the three data arrays. Level 0 (no indexing) is the default,
and 3 is where all 3 arrays are indexed via 3 different randomly shuffled
indexes. The higher the index setting the more impact this has on L1, L2
and L3 caching and hence forces higher memory read/write latencies.
.TP
.B \-\-stream\-l3\-size N
Specify the CPU Level 3 cache size in bytes.  One can specify the size in
units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
If the L3 cache size is not provided, then stress-ng will attempt to
determine the cache size, and failing this, will default the size to 4MB.
.TP
.B \-\-stream\-madvise [ hugepage | nohugepage | normal ]
Specify the madvise options used on the memory mapped buffer used in the
stream stressor. Non-linux systems will only have the 'normal' madvise
advice. The default is 'normal'.
.TP
.B \-\-swap N
start N workers that add and remove small randomly sizes swap partitions
(Linux only).  Note that if too many swap partitions are added then the
stressors may exit with exit code 3 (not enough resources).  Requires
CAP_SYS_ADMIN to run.

stop the swap workers after N swapon/swapoff iterations.
.TP
.B \-s N, \-\-switch N
start N workers that send messages via pipe to a child to force context
switching.

stop context switching workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-switch\-rate R
run the context switching at the rate of R context switches per second. Note
that the specified switch rate may not be achieved because of CPU speed
and memory bandwidth limitations.

stop symlink stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sync\-file N
start N workers that perform a range of data syncs across a file using
sync_file_range(2).  Three mixes of syncs are performed, from start to the end
of the file,  from end of the file to the start, and a random mix. A random
selection of valid sync types are used, covering the SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_BEFORE,
SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WRITE and SYNC_FILE_RANGE_WAIT_AFTER flag bits.
.TP
.B \-\-sync\-file\-ops N
stop sync\-file workers after N bogo sync operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sync\-file\-bytes N
specify the size of the file to be sync'd. One can specify the size as % of free
space on the file system in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the
suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-sysbadaddr N
start N workers that pass bad addresses to system calls to exercise bad address
and fault handling. The addresses used are null pointers, read only pages,
write only pages, unmapped addresses, text only pages, unaligned addresses and top of
memory addresses.
.TP
.B \-\-sysbadaddr\-ops N
stop the sysbadaddr stressors after N bogo system calls.
.TP
.B \-\-sysinfo N
start N workers that continually read system and process specific information.
This reads the process user and system times using the times(2) system call.
For Linux systems, it also reads overall system statistics using the sysinfo(2)
system call and also the file system statistics for all mounted file systems
using statfs(2).
.TP
.B \-\-sysinfo\-ops N
stop the sysinfo workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sysfs N
start N workers that recursively read files from /sys (Linux only).  This may
cause specific kernel drivers to emit messages into the kernel log.
.TP
.B \-\-sys\-ops N
stop sysfs reading after N bogo read operations. Note, since the number of
entries may vary between kernels, this bogo ops metric is probably very
misleading.
.TP
.B \-\-tee N
move data from a writer process to a reader process through pipes and to
/dev/null without any copying between kernel address space and user address
space using tee(2). This is only available for Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-tee-ops N
stop after N bogo tee operations.
.TP
.B \-T N, \-\-timer N
start N workers creating timer events at a default rate of 1 MHz (Linux only);
this can create a many thousands of timer clock interrupts. Each timer event
is caught by a signal handler and counted as a bogo timer op.

stop timer stress workers after N bogo timer events (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-timer\-freq F
run timers at F Hz; range from 1 to 1000000000 Hz (Linux only). By selecting
an appropriate frequency stress\-ng can generate hundreds of thousands of
interrupts per second.  Note: it is also worth using \-\-timer\-slack 0 for
high frequencies to stop the kernel from coalescing timer events.
.TP
.B \-\-timer\-rand
select a timer frequency based around the timer frequency +/- 12.5% random
jitter. This tries to force more variability in the timer interval to make the
scheduling less predictable.
.TP
.B \-\-timerfd N
start N workers creating timerfd events at a default rate of 1 MHz (Linux
only); this can create a many thousands of timer clock events. Timer events
are waited for on the timer file descriptor using select(2) and then read and
counted as a bogo timerfd op.

jitter. This tries to force more variability in the timer interval to make the
scheduling less predictable.
.TP
.B \-\-tlb\-shootdown N
start N workers that force Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) shootdowns.
This is achieved by creating up to 16 child processes that all share a
region of memory and these processes are shared amongst the available
CPUs.  The processes adjust the page mapping settings causing TLBs to
be force flushed on the other processors, causing the TLB shootdowns.
.TP

start N workers that exercise tree data structures. The default is
to add, find and remove 250,000 64 bit integers into AVL (avl),
Red-Black (rb), Splay (splay) and binary trees.  The intention of
this stressor is to exercise memory and cache with the various tree
operations.

specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4 and ipv6 are
supported.
.TP
.B \-\-udp\-flood\-ops N
stop udp-flood stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-unshare N
start N workers that each fork off 32 child processes, each of which exercises
the unshare(2) system call by disassociating parts of the process execution
context. (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-unshare\-ops N
stop after N bogo unshare operations.
.TP
.B \-u N, \-\-urandom N
start N workers reading /dev/urandom (Linux only). This will load the kernel
random number source.
.TP
.B \-\-urandom\-ops N
stop urandom stress workers after N urandom bogo read operations (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-userfaultfd N
start N workers that generate write page faults on a small anonymously mapped
memory region and handle these faults using the user space fault handling via
the userfaultfd mechanism.  This will generate a large quantity of major page
faults and also context switches during the handling of the page faults.
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-userfaultfd-ops N
stop userfaultfd stress workers after N page faults.
.TP
.B \-\-userfaultfd-bytes N
mmap N bytes per userfaultfd worker to page fault on, the default is 16MB.
One can specify the size as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes,
KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-utime N
start N workers updating file timestamps. This is mainly CPU bound when the
default is used as the system flushes metadata changes only periodically.
.TP
.B \-\-utime\-ops N
stop utime stress workers after N utime bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-utime\-fsync
force metadata changes on each file timestamp update to be flushed to disk.
This forces the test to become I/O bound and will result in many dirty metadata
writes.
.TP
.B \-\-vdso N
start N workers that repeatedly call each of the system call functions in the
vDSO (virtual dynamic shared object).  The vDSO is a shared library that the
kernel maps into the address space of all user-space applications to allow
fast access to kernel data to some system calls without the need of
performing an expensive system call.
.TP
.B \-\-vdso\-ops N
stop after N vDSO functions calls.
.TP
.B \-\-vdso\-func F
Instead of calling all the vDSO functions, just call the vDSO function F. The
functions depend on the kernel being used, but are typically clock_gettime,
getcpu, gettimeofday and time.
.TP
.B \-\-vecmath N
start N workers that perform various unsigned integer math operations on
various 128 bit vectors. A mix of vector math operations are performed on the
following vectors: 16 \(mu 8 bits, 8 \(mu 16 bits, 4 \(mu 32 bits, 2 \(mu 64
bits. The metrics produced by this mix depend on the processor architecture
and the vector math optimisations produced by the compiler.
.TP
.B \-\-vecmath\-ops N
stop after N bogo vector integer math operations.
.TP
.B \-\-vfork N
start N workers continually vforking children that immediately exit.
.TP
.B \-\-vfork\-ops N
stop vfork stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-vfork\-max P
create P processes and then wait for them to exit per iteration. The default
is just 1; higher values will create many temporary zombie processes that are
waiting to be reaped. One can potentially fill up the the process table using
high values for \-\-vfork\-max and \-\-vfork.
.TP
.B \-\-vforkmany N
start N workers that spawn off a chain of vfork children until the process
table fills up and/or vfork fails.  vfork can rapidly create child processes
and the parent process has to wait until the child dies, so this stressor
rapidly fills up the process table.
.TP
.B \-\-vforkmany\-ops N
stop vforkmany stressors after N vforks have been made.
.TP
.B \-m N, \-\-vm N
start N workers continuously calling mmap(2)/munmap(2) and writing to the
allocated memory. Note that this can cause systems to trip the kernel OOM
killer on Linux systems if not enough physical memory and swap is not
available.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-bytes N
mmap N bytes per vm worker, the default is 256MB. One can specify the size
as % of total available memory or in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes
using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-ops N
stop vm workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-hang N
sleep N seconds before unmapping memory, the default is zero seconds.
Specifying 0 will do an infinite wait.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-keep
do not continually unmap and map memory, just keep on re-writing to it.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-locked
Lock the pages of the mapped region into memory using mmap MAP_LOCKED (since
Linux 2.5.37).  This is similar to locking memory as described in mlock(2).
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-madvise advice
Specify the madvise 'advice' option used on the memory mapped regions used in
the vm stressor. Non-linux systems will only have the 'normal' madvise
advice, linux systems support 'dontneed', 'hugepage', 'mergeable'
, 'nohugepage', 'normal', 'random', 'sequential', 'unmergeable'
and 'willneed' advice. If this option is not used then the default is to pick
random madvise advice for each mmap call. See madvise(2) for more details.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-method m
specify a vm stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised
sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.
Each of the vm workers have 3 phases:
.RS
.PP
1. Initialised. The anonymously memory mapped region is set to a known pattern.
.PP
2. Exercised. Memory is modified in a known predictable way. Some vm workers
alter memory sequentially, some use small or large strides to step along memory.
.PP
3. Checked. The modified memory is checked to see if it matches the expected
result.
.PP
The vm methods containing 'prime' in their name have a stride of the largest
prime less than 2^64, allowing to them to thoroughly step through memory and
touch all locations just once while also doing without touching memory cells
next to each other. This strategy exercises the cache and page non-locality.
.PP
Since the memory being exercised is virtually mapped then there is no
guarantee of touching page addresses in any particular physical order.  These
workers should not be used to test that all the system's memory is working
correctly either, use tools such as memtest86 instead.
.PP
The vm stress methods are intended to exercise memory in ways to possibly find
memory issues and to try to force thermal errors.
.PP
Available vm stress methods are described as follows:
.TS
expand;
lBw(10n)2 lBw(\n[SV]n)
l l.
Method	Description
all	T{
iterate over all the vm stress methods as listed below.
T}
flip	T{
sequentially work through memory 8 times, each time just one bit in memory
flipped (inverted). This will effectively invert each byte in 8 passes.
T}
galpat-0	T{
galloping pattern zeros. This sets all bits to 0 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits
to 1. It then checks to see if the 1s are pulled down to 0 by their neighbours
or of the neighbours have been pulled up to 1.
T}
galpat-1	T{
galloping pattern ones. This sets all bits to 1 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits
to 0. It then checks to see if the 0s are pulled up to 1 by their neighbours
or of the neighbours have been pulled down to 0.
T}
gray	T{
fill the memory with sequential gray codes (these only change 1 bit at a time
between adjacent bytes) and then check if they are set correctly.
T}
incdec	T{
work sequentially through memory twice, the first pass increments each byte by
a specific value and the second pass decrements each byte back to the original
start value. The increment/decrement value changes on each invocation of the
stressor.
T}
inc-nybble	T{
initialise memory to a set value (that changes on each invocation of the
stressor) and then sequentially work through each byte incrementing the bottom
4 bits by 1 and the top 4 bits by 15.
T}
rand-set	T{
sequentially work through memory in 64 bit chunks setting bytes in the chunk
to the same 8 bit random value.  The random value changes on each chunk.
Check that the values have not changed.
T}
rand-sum	T{
sequentially set all memory to random values and then summate the number of
bits that have changed from the original set values.
T}
read64	T{
sequentially read memory using 32 x 64 bit reads per bogo loop. Each loop
equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory reads.
T}
ror	T{
fill memory with a random pattern and then sequentially rotate 64 bits of
memory right by one bit, then check the final load/rotate/stored values.
T}
swap	T{
fill memory in 64 byte chunks with random patterns. Then swap each 64 chunk
with a randomly chosen chunk. Finally, reverse the swap to put the chunks back
to their original place and check if the data is correct. This exercises
adjacent and random memory load/stores.
T}
move-inv	T{
sequentially fill memory 64 bits of memory at a time with random values, and
then check if the memory is set correctly.  Next, sequentially invert each 64
bit pattern and again check if the memory is set as expected.
T}
modulo-x	T{
fill memory over 23 iterations. Each iteration starts one byte further along
from the start of the memory and steps along in 23 byte strides. In each
stride, the first byte is set to a random pattern and all other bytes are set
to the inverse.  Then it checks see if the first byte contains the expected
random pattern. This exercises cache store/reads as well as seeing if
neighbouring cells influence each other.
T}
prime-0	T{
iterate 8 times by stepping through memory in very large prime strides clearing
just on bit at a time in every byte. Then check to see if all bits are set to
zero.
T}
prime-1	T{
iterate 8 times by stepping through memory in very large prime strides setting
just on bit at a time in every byte. Then check to see if all bits are set to
one.
T}
prime-gray-0	T{
first step through memory in very large prime strides clearing just on bit
(based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but clear the other
7 bits. Then check to see if all bits are set to zero.
T}
prime-gray-1	T{
first step through memory in very large prime strides setting just on bit
(based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but set the other 7
bits. Then check to see if all bits are set to one.
T}
rowhammer	T{
try to force memory corruption using the rowhammer memory stressor. This
fetches two 32 bit integers from memory and forces a cache flush on the two
addresses multiple times. This has been known to force bit flipping on some
hardware, especially with lower frequency memory refresh cycles.
T}
walk-0d	T{
for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to low (and
the others are set high) and check that the written value is as expected. This
checks if any data lines are stuck.
T}
walk-1d	T{
for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to high (and
the others are set low) and check that the written value is as expected. This
checks if any data lines are stuck.
T}
walk-0a	T{
in the given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses
working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck low. This
works best with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual
addresses has some value too.
T}
walk-1a	T{
in the given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses
working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck high. This
works best with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual
addresses has some value too.
T}
write64	T{
sequentially write memory using 32 x 64 bit writes per bogo loop. Each loop
equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory writes.  Note that
memory writes are not checked at the end of each test iteration.
T}
zero-one	T{
set all memory bits to zero and then check if any bits are not zero. Next, set
all the memory bits to one and check if any bits are not one.
T}

start N workers that exercise virtual memory addressing using various
methods to walk through a memory mapped address range. This will exercise

stress\-ng was written by Colin King <colin.king@canonical.com> and
is a clean room re-implementation and extension of the original
stress tool by Amos Waterland. Thanks also for

.SH NOTES
Sending a SIGALRM, SIGINT or SIGHUP to stress-ng causes it to
terminate all the stressor processes and ensures temporary files and
shared memory segments are removed cleanly.
.PP
Sending a SIGUSR2 to stress-ng will dump out the current load average
and memory statistics.
.PP
Note that the stress\-ng cpu, io, vm and hdd tests are different
implementations of the original stress
tests and hence may produce different stress characteristics.
stress\-ng does not support any GPU stress tests.
.PP
The bogo operations metrics may change with each release  because of bug
fixes to the code, new features, compiler optimisations or changes in system
call performance.
