.SH NAME
stress\-ng \- a tool to load and stress a computer system
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stress\-ng
[\fIOPTION \fR[\fIARG\fR]] ...
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
stress\-ng will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It
was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well
as the various operating system kernel interfaces.
stress\-ng also has a wide range of CPU specific stress tests that exercise
floating point, integer, bit manipulation and control flow.
.PP
stress\-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip
hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating
system bugs that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use
stress\-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot
on poorly designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing
which may be difficult to stop.
.PP
stress\-ng can also measure test throughput rates; this can be
useful to observe performance changes across different
operating system releases or types of hardware. However, it has never been
intended to be used as a precise benchmark test suite, so do NOT use it
in this manner.
.PP
Running stress\-ng with root privileges will adjust out of memory settings
on Linux systems to make the stressors unkillable in low memory situations,
so use this judiciously.  With the appropriate privilege, stress\-ng can allow
the ionice class and ionice levels to be adjusted, again, this should be
used with care.
.PP
One can specify the number of processes to invoke per type of stress test;
specifying a negative or zero value will select the number of processors
available as defined by sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF).
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B General stress\-ng control options:
.TP
.B \-\-aggressive
enables more file, cache and memory aggressive options. This may slow tests
down, increase latencies and reduce the number of bogo ops as well as changing
the balance of user time vs system time used depending on the type of stressor
being used.
.TP
.B \-a N, \-\-all N
start N instances of each stressor. If N is less than zero, then the number
of CPUs online is used for the number of instances.  If N is zero, then the
number of CPUs in the system is used.
.TP
.B \-b N, \-\-backoff N
wait N microseconds between the start of each stress worker process. This
allows one to ramp up the stress tests over time.
.TP
.B \-\-class name
specify the class of stressors to run. Stressors are classified into one or
more of the following classes: cpu, cpu-cache, device, io, interrupt,
filesystem, memory, network, os, pipe, scheduler and vm.  Some stressors fall
into just one class. For example the 'get' stressor is just in the 'os'
class. Other stressors fall into more than one class, for example,
the 'lsearch' stressor falls into the 'cpu', 'cpu-cache' and 'memory' classes
as it exercises all these three.  Selecting a specific class will run all
the stressors that fall into that class only when run with the \-\-sequential
option.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-dry\-run
parse options, but do not run stress tests. A no-op.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
show help.
.TP
.B \-\-ignite\-cpu
alter kernel controls to try and maximize the CPU. This requires root
privilege to alter various /sys interface controls.  Currently this only
works for Intel P-State enabled x86 systems on Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice\-class class
specify ionice class (only on Linux). Can be idle (default), besteffort, be,
realtime, rt.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice\-level level
specify ionice level (only on Linux). For idle, 0 is the only possible
option. For besteffort or realtime values 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest
priority). See ionice(1) for more details.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keep\-name
by default, stress\-ng will attempt to change the name of the stress
processes according to their functionality; this option disables this and
keeps the process names to be the name of the parent process, that is,
stress\-ng.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-brief
by default stress\-ng will report the name of the program, the message type
and the process id as a prefix to all output. The \-\-log\-brief option will
output messages without these fields to produce a less verbose output.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file filename
write messages to the specified log file.
.TP
.B \-\-maximize
overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the maximum
settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor
settings options if required.
.TP
.B \-\-metrics
output number of bogo operations in total performed by the stress processes.
Note that these are not a reliable metric of performance or throughput and
have not been designed to be used for benchmarking whatsoever. The metrics are
just a useful way to observe how a system behaves when under various kinds of
load.
.RS
.PP
The following columns of information are output:
.TS

lB lBw(\n[SM]n)

Column Heading	Explanation
T{
bogo ops
T}	T{
number of iterations of the stressor during the run. This is metric of
how much overall "work" has been achieved in bogo operations.
T}
T{
real time (secs)
T}	T{
average wall clock duration (in seconds) of the stressor. This is the total
wall clock time of all the instances of that particular stressor divided by
the number of these stressors being run.
T}
T{
usr time (secs)
T}	T{
total user time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the
stressor.
T}
T{
sys time (secs)
T}	T{
total system time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the
stressor.
T}
T{
bogo ops/s (real time)
T}	T{
total bogo operations per second based on wall clock run time. The wall clock
time reflects the apparent run time. The more processors one has on a system
the more the work load can be distributed onto these and hence the wall clock
time will reduce and the bogo ops rate will increase.  This is essentially
the "apparent" bogo ops rate of the system.
T}
T{
bogo ops/s (usr+sys time)
T}	T{
total bogo operations per second based on cumulative user and system time.
This is the real bogo ops rate of the system taking into consideration the
actual time execution time of the stressor across all the processors.
Generally this will decrease as one adds more concurrent stressors due to
contention on cache, memory, execution units, buses and I/O devices.
T}
.TE
.RE
.TP
.B -\-metrics\-brief
enable metrics and only output metrics that are non-zero.
.TP
.B \-\-minimize
overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the minimum
settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor
settings options if required.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-advise
from version 0.02.26 stress\-ng automatically calls madvise(2) with random
advise options before each mmap and munmap to stress the the vm subsystem a
little harder. The \-\-no\-advise option turns this default off.
.TP
.B \-\-page\-in
touch allocated pages that are not in core, forcing them to be paged back in.
This is a useful option to force all the allocated pages to be paged in when
using the bigheap, mmap and vm stressors.  It will severely degrade
performance when the memory in the system is less than the allocated buffer
sizes.  This uses mincore(2) to determine the pages that are not in core and
hence need touching to page them back in.
.TP
.B \-\-pathological
enable stressors that are known to hang systems.  Some stressors can quickly
consume resources in such a way that they can rapidly hang a system before
the kernel can OOM kill them. These stressors are not enabled by default,
this option enables them, but you probably don't want to do this. You have
been warned.
.TP
.B \-\-perf
measure processor and system activity using perf events. Linux only and
caveat emptor, according to perf_event_open(2): "Always double-check your
results! Various generalized events have had wrong values."
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
do not show any output.
.TP
.B \-r N, \-\-random N
start N random stress workers. If N is 0, then the number of configured
processors is used for N.
.TP
.B \-\-sched scheduler
select the named scheduler (only on Linux). To see the list of available
schedulers use: stress\-ng \-\-sched which
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-prio prio
select the scheduler priority level (only on Linux). If the scheduler does
not support this then the default priority level of 0 is chosen.
.TP
.B \-\-sequential N
sequentially run all the stressors one by one for a default of 60 seconds. The
number of instances of each of the individual stressors to be started is N.  If
N is less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number
of instances.  If N is zero, then the number of CPUs in the system is used.
Use the \-\-timeout option to specify the duration to run each stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-syslog
log output (except for verbose \-v messages) to the syslog.
.TP
.B \-\-taskset list
set CPU affinity based on the list of CPUs provided; stress-ng is bound to
just use these CPUs (Linux only). The CPUs to be used are specified by a
comma separated list of CPU (0 to N-1). One can specify a range of CPUs
using '-', for example: \-\-taskset 0,2-3,6,7-11
.TP
.B \-\-temp\-path path
specify a path for stress\-ng temporary directories and temporary files;
the default path is the current working directory.  This path must have
read and write access for the stress-ng stress processes.
.TP
.B \-t N, \-\-timeout N
stop stress test after N seconds. One can also specify the units of time in
seconds, minutes, hours, days or years with the suffix s, m, h, d or y.
.TP
.B \-\-timer\-slack N
adjust the per process timer slack to N nanoseconds (Linux only). Increasing
the timer slack allows the kernel to coalesce timer events by adding some
fuzzinesss to timer expiration times and hence reduce wakeups.  Conversely,
decreasing the timer slack will increase wakeups.  A value of 0 for the
timer-slack will set the system default of 50,000 nanoseconds.
.TP
.B \-\-times
show the cumulative user and system times of all the child processes at the
end of the stress run.  The percentage of utilisation of available CPU time is
also calculated from the number of on-line CPUs in the system.
.TP
.B \-\-tz
collect temperatures from the available thermal zones on the machine (Linux
only).  Some devices may have one or more thermal zones, where as others may
have none.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
show all debug, warnings and normal information output.
.TP
.B \-\-verify
verify results when a test is run. This is not available on all tests. This
will sanity check the computations or memory contents from a test run and
report to stderr any unexpected failures.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
show version.
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-exclude list
specify a list of one or more stressors to exclude (that is, do not run them).
This is useful to exclude specific stressors when one selects many stressors
to run using the \-\-class option, \-\-sequential, \-\-all and \-\-random
options. Example, run the cpu class stressors concurrently and exclude the
numa and search stressors:
.IP
stress\-ng \-\-class cpu \-\-all 1 \-x numa,bsearch,hsearch,lsearch
.TP
.B \-Y, \-\-yaml filename
output gathered statistics to a YAML formatted file named 'filename'.
.br
.sp 2
.PP
.B Stressor specific options:
.TP
.B \-\-affinity N
start N workers that rapidly change CPU affinity (only on Linux). Rapidly
switching CPU affinity can contribute to poor cache behaviour.
.TP
.B \-\-affinity\-ops N
stop affinity workers after N bogo affinity operations (only on Linux).
.TP
.B \-\-affinity\-rand
switch CPU affinity randomly rather than the default of sequentially.
.TP
.B \-\-af\-alg N
start N workers that exercise the AF_ALG socket domain by hashing and encrypting
various sized random messages. This exercises the SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384,
SHA512, MD4, MD5, RMD128, RMD160, RMD256, RMD320, WP256, WP384, WP512, TGR128,
TGR160, TGR192 hashes and the cbc(aes), lrw(aes), ofb(aes), xts(twofish),
xts(serpent), xts(cast6), xts(camellia), lrw(twofish), lrw(cast6), lrw(camellia),
salsa20 skcipers.
.TP
.B \-\-af\-alg\-ops N
stop af\-alg workers after N AF_ALG messages are hashed.
.TP
.B \-\-aio N
start N workers that issue multiple small asynchronous I/O writes and reads on
a relatively small temporary file using the POSIX aio interface.  This will
just hit the file system cache and soak up a lot of user and kernel time in
issuing and handling I/O requests.  By default, each worker process will
handle 16 concurrent I/O requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aio\-ops N
stop POSIX asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aio\-requests N
specify the number of POSIX asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue,
the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-aiol N
start N workers that issue multiple 4K random asynchronous I/O writes using
the Linux aio system calls io_setup(2), io_submit(2), io_getevents(2) and
io_destroy(2).  By default, each worker process will handle 16 concurrent I/O
requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aiol\-ops N
stop Linux asynchronous I/O workers after N bogo asynchronous I/O requests.
.TP
.B \-\-aiol\-requests N
specify the number of Linux asynchronous I/O requests each worker should issue,
the default is 16; 1 to 4096 are allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-apparmor N
start N workers that exercise various parts of the AppArmor interface. Currently
one needs root permission to run this particular test. This test is only available
on Linux systems with AppArmor support.
.TP
.B \-\-apparmor-ops
stop the AppArmor workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-atomic N
start N workers that exercise various GCC __atomic_*() build in operations
on 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit intergers that are shared among the N workers. This
stressor is only available for builds using GCC 4.7.4 or higher. The stressor
forces many front end cache stalls and cache references.
.TP
.B \-\-atomic\-ops N
stop the atomic workers after N bogo atomic operations.
.TP
.B \-B N, \-\-bigheap N
start N workers that grow their heaps by reallocating memory. If the out of
memory killer (OOM) on Linux kills the worker or the allocation fails then the
allocating process starts all over again.  Note that the OOM adjustment for the
worker is set so that the OOM killer will treat these workers as the first
candidate processes to kill.
.TP
.B \-\-bigheap\-ops N
stop the big heap workers after N bogo allocation operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-bigheap\-growth N
specify amount of memory to grow heap by per iteration. Size can be from 4K to
64MB. Default is 64K.
.TP
.B \-\-bind\-mount N
start N workers that repeatedly bind mount / to / inside a user namespace. This
can consume resources rapidly, forcing out of memory situations. Do not use this
stressor unless you want to risk hanging your machine.
.TP
.B \-\-bind\-mount\-ops N
stop after N bind mount bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-brk N
start N workers that grow the data segment by one page at a time using multiple
brk(2) calls. Each successfully allocated new page is touched to ensure it is
resident in memory.  If an out of memory condition occurs then the test will
reset the data segment to the point before it started and repeat the data
segment resizing over again.  The process adjusts the out of memory setting so
that it may be killed by the out of memory (OOM) killer before other processes.
If it is killed by the OOM killer then it will be automatically re-started by
a monitoring parent process.
.TP
.B \-\-brk\-ops N
stop the brk workers after N bogo brk operations.
.TP
.B \-\-brk\-notouch
do not touch each newly allocated data segment page. This disables the default
of touching each newly allocated page and hence avoids the kernel from
necessarily backing the page with real physical memory.
.TP
.B \-\-bsearch N
start N workers that binary search a sorted array of 32 bit integers using
bsearch(3). By default, there are 65536 elements in the array.  This is a
useful method to exercise random access of memory and processor cache.
.TP
.B \-\-bsearch\-ops N
stop the bsearch worker after N bogo bsearch operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-bsearch\-size N
specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to bsearch. Size can
be from 1K to 4M.
.TP
.B \-C N, \-\-cache N
start N workers that perform random wide spread memory read and writes to
thrash the CPU cache.  The code does not intelligently determine the CPU cache
configuration and so it may be sub-optimal in producing hit-miss read/write
activity for some processors.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-fence
force write serialization on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op
for non-x86 architectures.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-flush
force flush cache on each store operation (x86 only). This is a no-op for
non-x86 architectures.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-level N
specify level of cache to exercise (1=L1 cache, 2=L2 cache, 3=L3/LLC cache (the default)).
If the cache hierarchy cannot be determined, built-in defaults will apply.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-no\-affinity
do not change processor affinity when
.B \-\-cache
is in effect.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-ops N
stop cache thrash workers after N bogo cache thrash operations.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-prefetch
force read prefetch on next read address on architectures that support
prefetching.
.TP
.B \-\-cache\-ways N
specify the number of cache ways to exercise. This allows a subset of
the overall cache size to be exercised.
.TP
.B \-\-cap N
start N workers that read per process capabililties via calls to capget(2)
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-cap\-ops N
stop after N cap bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chdir N
start N workers that change directory between 8192 directories using chdir(2).
.TP
.B \-\-chdir\-ops N
stop after N chdir bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chmod N
start N workers that change the file mode bits via chmod(2) and fchmod(2) on
the same file. The greater the value for N then the more contention on the
single file.  The stressor will work through all the combination of mode bits.
.TP
.B \-\-chmod\-ops N
stop after N chmod bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-chown N
start N workers that exercise chown(2) on the same file. The greater the
value for N then the more contention on the single file.
.TP
.B \-\-chown\-ops N
stop the chown workers after N bogo chown(2) operations.
.TP
.B \-\-clock N
start N workers exercising clocks and POSIX timers. For all known clock types
this will exercise clock_getres(2), clock_gettime(2) and clock_nanosleep(2).
For all known timers it will create a 50000ns timer and busy poll this until
it expires.  This stressor will cause frequent context switching.
.TP
.B \-\-clock\-ops N
stop clock stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-clone N
start N workers that create clones (via the clone(2) system call). This will
rapidly try to create a default of 8192 clones that immediately die and wait in
a zombie state until they are reaped.  Once the maximum number of clones is
reached (or clone fails because one has reached the maximum allowed) the oldest
clone thread is reaped and a new clone is then created in a first-in first-out
manner, and then repeated.  A random clone flag is selected for each clone to
try to exercise different clone operarions.  The clone stressor is a Linux only
option.
.TP
.B \-\-clone\-ops N
stop clone stress workers after N bogo clone operations.
.TP
.B \-\-clone\-max N
try to create as many as N clone threads. This may not be reached if the system
limit is less than N.
.TP
.B \-\-context N
start N workers that run three threads that use swapcontext(3) to implement the
thread-to-thread context switching. This exercises rapid process context saving
and restoring and is bandwidth limited by register and memory save and restore
rates.
.TP
.B \-\-context\-ops N
stop N context workers after N bogo context switches.  In this stressor, 1 bogo
op is equivalent to 1000 swapcontext calls.
.TP
.B \-\-copy\-file N
start N stressors that copy a file using the Linux copy_file_range(2) system
call. 2MB chunks of data are copyied from random locations from one file to
random locations to a destination file.  By default, the files are 256 MB in
size. Data is sync'd to the filesystem after each copy_file_range(2) call.
.TP
.B \-\-copy\-file\-ops N
stop after N copy_file_range() calls.
.TP
.B \-\-copy\-file\-bytes N
copy file size, the default is 256 MB. One can specify the size in units of
Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-c N, \-\-cpu N
start N workers exercising the CPU by sequentially working through all the
different CPU stress methods. Instead of exercising all the CPU stress methods,
one can specify a specific CPU stress method with the \-\-cpu\-method option.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-ops N
stop cpu stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-l P, \-\-cpu\-load P
load CPU with P percent loading for the CPU stress workers. 0 is effectively a
sleep (no load) and 100 is full loading.  The loading loop is broken into
compute time (load%) and sleep time (100% - load%). Accuracy depends on the
overall load of the processor and the responsiveness of the scheduler, so the
actual load may be different from the desired load.  Note that the number of
bogo CPU operations may not be linearly scaled with the load as some systems
employ CPU frequency scaling and so heavier loads produce an increased CPU
frequency and greater CPU bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-load\-slice S
note \- this option is only useful when \-\-cpu\-load is less than 100%. The
CPU load is broken into multiple busy and idle cycles. Use this option to
specify the duration of a busy time slice.  A negative value for S specifies
the number of iterations to run before idling the CPU (e.g. -30 invokes 30
iterations of a CPU stress loop).  A zero value selects a random busy time
between 0 and 0.5 seconds.  A positive value for S specifies the number of
milliseconds to run before idling the CPU (e.g. 100 keeps the CPU busy for
0.1 seconds).  Specifying small values for S lends to small time slices and
smoother scheduling.  Setting \-\-cpu\-load as a relatively low value and
\-\-cpu\-load\-slice to be large will cycle the CPU between long idle and
busy cycles and exercise different CPU frequencies.  The thermal range of
the CPU is also cycled, so this is a good mechanism to exercise the scheduler,
frequency scaling and passive/active thermal cooling mechanisms.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-method method
specify a cpu stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised
sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.
Available cpu stress methods are described as follows:

Note that some of these methods try to exercise the CPU with computations found
in some real world use cases. However, the code has not been optimised on a
per-architecture basis, so may be a sub-optimal compared to hand-optimised code
used in some applications.  They do try to represent the typical instruction
mixes found in these use cases.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-online N
start N workers that put randomly selected CPUs offline and online. This Linux
only stressor requires root privilege to perform this action.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-online\-ops N
stop after offline/online operations.
.TP
.B \-\-crypt N
start N workers that encrypt a 16 character random password using crypt(3).
The password is encrypted using MD5, SHA-256 and SHA-512 encryption methods.
.TP
.B \-\-crypt\-ops N
stop after N bogo encryption operations.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon N
start N workers that each create a daemon that dies immediately after creating
another daemon and so on. This effectively works through the process table with
short lived processes that do not have a parent and are waited for by init.
This puts pressure on init to do rapid child reaping.  The daemon processes
perform the usual mix of calls to turn into typical UNIX daemons, so this
artificially mimics very heavy daemon system stress.
.TP
.B \-\-daemon\-ops N
stop daemon workers after N daemons have been created.
.TP
.B \-D N, \-\-dentry N
start N workers that create and remove directory entries.  This should create
file system meta data activity. The directory entry names are suffixed by a
gray-code encoded number to try to mix up the hashing of the namespace.
.TP
.B \-\-dentry\-ops N
stop denty thrash workers after N bogo dentry operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dentry\-order [ forward | reverse | stride | random ]
specify unlink order of dentries, can be one of forward, reverse, stride
or random.
By default, dentries are unlinked in random order.  The forward
order will unlink them from first to last, reverse order will unlink
them from last to first, stride order will unlink them by stepping
around order in a quasi-random pattern and random order will randomly
select one of forward, reverse or stride orders.
.TP
.B \-\-dentries N
create N dentries per dentry thrashing loop, default is 2048.

start N workers that create and remove directories using mkdir and rmdir.
.TP
.B \-\-dir\-ops N
stop directory thrash workers after N bogo directory operations.
.TP
.B \-\-dup N
start N workers that perform dup(2) and then close(2) operations on /dev/zero.
The maximum opens at one time is system defined, so the test will run up to
this maximum, or 65536 open file descriptors, which ever comes first.
.TP
.B \-\-dup\-ops N
stop the dup stress workers after N bogo open operations.
.TP
.B \-\-epoll N
start N workers that perform various related socket stress activity using
epoll_wait(2) to monitor and handle new connections. This involves
client/server processes performing rapid connect, send/receives and disconnects
on the local host.  Using epoll allows a large number of connections to be
efficiently handled, however, this can lead to the connection table filling up
and blocking further socket connections, hence impacting on the epoll bogo op
stats.  For ipv4 and ipv6 domains, multiple servers are spawned on multiple
ports. The epoll stressor is for Linux only.
.TP
.B \-\-epoll\-domain D
specify the domain to use, the default is unix (aka local). Currently ipv4,
ipv6 and unix are supported.
.TP
.B \-\-epoll\-port P

.B \-\-exec N
start N workers continually forking children that exec stress-ng and then exit
almost immediately.
.TP
.B \-\-exec\-ops N
stop exec stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-exec\-max P
create P child processes that exec stress-ng and then wait for them to exit per
iteration. The default is just 1; higher values will create many temporary
zombie processes that are waiting to be reaped. One can potentially fill up the
process table using high values for \-\-exec\-max and \-\-exec.
.TP
.B \-F N, \-\-fallocate N
start N workers continually fallocating (preallocating file space) and
ftuncating (file truncating) temporary files.  If the file is larger than the
free space, fallocate will produce an ENOSPC error which is ignored by this
stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-fallocate\-bytes N
allocated file size, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size in units of
Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

the FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl(2).
.TP
.B \-\-fiemap\-ops N
stop after N fiemap bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-fiemap\-size N
specify the size of the fiemap'd file in bytes.  One can specify the size
in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
Larger files will contain more extents, causing more stress when gathering
extent information.

Option	Description
direct	T{
try to minimize cache effects of the I/O. File I/O writes are performed
directly from user space buffers and synchronous transfer is also attempted.
To guarantee synchronous I/O, also use the sync option.
T}
dsync	T{
ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware and file metadata
has been updated (using the O_DSYNC open flag). This is equivalent to each
write(2) being followed by a call to fdatasync(2). See also the fdatasync
option.
T}
fadv\-dontneed	T{
advise kernel to expect the data will not be accessed in the near future.
T}
fadv\-noreuse	T{
advise kernel to expect the data to be accessed only once.

fadv\-normal	T{
advise kernel there are no explicit access pattern for the data. This is the
default advice assumption.

fadv\-seq	T{
advise kernel to expect sequential access patterns for the data.
T}
fadv\-willneed	T{
advise kernel to expect the data to be accessed in the near future.
T}
fsync	T{
flush all modified in-core data after each write to the output device using an
explicit fsync(2) call.
T}
fdatasync	T{
similar to fsync, but do not flush the modified metadata unless metadata is
required for later data reads to be handled correctly. This uses an explicit
fdatasync(2) call.
T}
iovec	T{
use readv/writev multiple buffer I/Os rather than read/write. Instead of 1
read/write operation, the buffer is broken into an iovec of 16 buffers.
T}
noatime	T{
do not update the file last access timestamp, this can reduce metadata writes.
T}
sync	T{
ensure output has been transferred to underlying hardware (using the O_SYNC
open flag). This is equivalent to a each write(2) being followed by a call to
fsync(2). See also the fsync option.
T}
rd\-rnd	T{
read data randomly. By default, written data is not read back, however, this
option will force it to be read back randomly.
T}
rd\-seq	T{
read data sequentially. By default, written data is not read back, however,
this option will force it to be read back sequentially.
T}
syncfs	T{
write all buffered modifications of file metadata and data on the filesystem
that contains the hdd worker files.
T}
utimes	T{
force update of file timestamp which may increase metadata writes.
T}
wr\-rnd	T{
write data randomly. The wr\-seq option cannot be used at the same time.
T}
wr\-seq	T{
write data sequentially. This is the default if no write modes are specified.

.B \-\-icache N
start N workers that stress the instruction cache by forcing instruction cache
reloads.  This is achieved by modifying an instruction cache line,  causing
the processor to reload it when we call a function in inside it. Currently
only verified and enabled for Intel x86 CPUs.
.TP
.B \-\-icache\-ops N
stop the icache workers after N bogo icache operations are completed.

files/directories, moving files, etc. to stress exercise the various inotify
events (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-inotify\-ops N
stop inotify stress workers after N inotify bogo operations.

(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-ioprio\-ops N
stop after N io priority bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer N
start N workers that exercise the system interval timers. This sets up an
ITIMER_PROF itimer that generates a SIGPROF signal.  The default frequency for
the itimer is 1 MHz, however, the Linux kernel will set this to be no more that
the jiffy setting, hence high frequency SIGPROF signals are not normally
possible.  A busy loop spins on getitimer(2) calls to consume CPU and hence
decrement the itimer based on amount of time spent in CPU and system time.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer\-ops N
stop itimer stress workers after N bogo itimer SIGPROF signals.
.TP
.B \-\-itimer\-freq F
run itimer at F Hz; range from 1 to 1000000 Hz. Normally the highest frequency
is limited by the number of jiffy ticks per second, so running above 1000 Hz
is difficult to attain in practice.

.B \-\-kcmp N
start N workers that use kcmp(2) to compare parent and child processes to
determine if they share kernel resources (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-kcmp\-ops N
stop kcmp workers after N bogo kcmp operations.
.TP
.B \-\-key N
start N workers that create and manipulate keys using add_key(2) and
ketctl(2). As many keys are created as the per user limit allows and then the
following keyctl commands are exercised on each key: KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT,
KEYCTL_DESCRIBE, KEYCTL_UPDATE, KEYCTL_READ, KEYCTL_CLEAR and
KEYCTL_INVALIDATE.
.TP
.B \-\-key\-ops N
stop key workers after N bogo key operations.

.B \-\-klog\-ops N
stop klog workers after N syslog operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lease N
start N workers locking, unlocking and breaking leases via the fcntl(2)
F_SETLEASE operation. The parent processes continually lock and unlock a lease
on a file while a user selectable number of child processes open the file with
a non-blocking open to generate SIGIO lease breaking notifications to the
parent.  This stressor is only available if F_SETLEASE, F_WRLCK and F_UNLCK
support is provided by fcntl(2).
.TP
.B \-\-lease\-ops N
stop lease workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-lease\-breakers N
start N lease breaker child processes per lease worker.  Normally one child is
plenty to force many SIGIO lease breaking notification signals to the parent,
however, this option allows one to specify more child processes if required.

.B \-\-locka N
start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the
POSIX advisory locking mechanism (see fcntl(2), F_SETLK, F_GETLK). Each
worker creates a 1024 KB file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024
concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024
concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.

.B \-\-lockf\-nonblock
instead of using blocking F_LOCK lockf(3) commands, use non-blocking F_TLOCK
commands and re-try if the lock failed.  This creates extra system call
overhead and CPU utilisation as the number of lockf workers increases and
should increase locking contention.
.TP
.B \-\-lockofd N
start N workers that randomly lock and unlock regions of a file using the
Linux open file description locks (see fcntl(2), F_OFD_SETLK, F_OFD_GETLK).
Each worker creates a 1024 KB file and attempts to hold a maximum of 1024
concurrent locks with a child process that also tries to hold 1024
concurrent locks. Old locks are unlocked in a first-in, first-out basis.
.TP
.B \-\-lockofd\-ops N
stop lockofd workers after N bogo lockofd operations.
.TP
.B \-\-longjmp N
start N workers that exercise setjmp(3)/longjmp(3) by rapid looping on
longjmp calls.
.TP
.B \-\-longjmp-ops N
stop longjmp stress workers after N bogo longjmp operations (1 bogo op is 1000
longjmp calls).
.TP
.B \-\-lsearch N
start N workers that linear search a unsorted array of 32 bit integers using
lsearch(3). By default, there are 8192 elements in the array.  This is a
useful method to exercise sequential access of memory and processor cache.
.TP
.B \-\-lsearch\-ops N
stop the lsearch workers after N bogo lsearch operations are completed.
.TP
.B \-\-lsearch\-size N
specify the size (number of 32 bit integers) in the array to lsearch. Size can
be from 1K to 4M.
.TP
.B \-\-madvise N
start N workers that apply random madvise(2) advise settings on pages of
a 4MB file backed shared memory mapping.
.TP
.B \-\-madvice\-ops N
stop madvise stressors after N bogo madvise operations.
.TP
.B \-\-malloc N
start N workers continuously calling malloc(3), calloc(3), realloc(3) and
free(3). By default, up to 65536 allocations can be active at any point, but
this can be altered with the \-\-malloc\-max option.  Allocation, reallocation
and freeing are chosen at random; 50% of the time memory is allocation (via
malloc, calloc or realloc) and 50% of the time allocations are free'd.
Allocation sizes are also random, with the maximum allocation size controlled
by the \-\-malloc\-bytes option, the default size being 64K.  The worker is
re-started if it is killed by the out of mememory (OOM) killer.
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-bytes N
maximum per allocation/reallocation size. Allocations are randomly selected
from 1 to N bytes. One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes
and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.  Large allocation sizes cause the
memory allocator to use mmap(2) rather than expanding the heap using brk(2).
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-max N
maximum number of active allocations allowed. Allocations are chosen at ramdom
and placed in an allocation slot. Because about 50%/50% split between
allocation and freeing, typically half of the allocation slots are in use at
any one time.
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-ops N
stop after N malloc bogo operations. One bogo operations relates to a
successful malloc(3), calloc(3) or realloc(3).
.TP
.B \-\-malloc\-thresh N
specify the threshold where malloc uses mmap(2) instead of sbrk(2) to allocate
more memory. This is only available on systems that provide the GNU C
mallopt(3) tuning function.
.TP
.B \-\-matrix N
start N workers that perform various matrix operations on floating point
values. By default, this will exercise all the matrix stress methods one by
one.  One can specify a specific matrix stress method with the
\-\-matrix\-method option.
.TP
.B \-\-matrix\-ops N
stop matrix stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-matrix\-method method

.TE
.TP
.B \-\-matrix\-size N
specify the N \(mu N size of the matrices.  Smaller values result in a
floating point compute throughput bound stressor, where as large values result
in a cache and/or memory bandwidth bound stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-membarrier N
start N workers that exercise the membarrier system call (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-membarrier\-ops N
stop membarrier stress workers after N bogo membarrier operations.
.TP
.B \-\-memcpy N
start N workers that copy 2MB of data from a shared region to a buffer using
memcpy(3) and then move the data in the buffer with memmove(3) with 3
different alignments. This will exercise processor cache and system memory.
.TP
.B \-\-memcpy\-ops N
stop memcpy stress workers after N bogo memcpy operations.
.TP
.B \-\-memfd N
start N workers that create 256 allocations of 1024 pages using memfd_create(2)
and ftruncate(2) for allocation and mmap(2) to map the allocation into the
process address space.  (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-memfd\-bytes N
allocate N bytes per memfd stress worker, the default is 256MB. One can specify
the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m
.TP
.B \-\-memfd\-ops N
stop after N memfd-create(2) bogo operations.
.TP
.B -\-mergesort N
start N workers that sort 32 bit integers using the BSD mergesort.
.TP
.B \-\-mergesort\-ops N
stop mergesort stress workers after N bogo mergesorts.
.TP
.B \-\-mergesort\-size N
specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 262144 (256 \(mu 1024).
.TP
.B \-\-mincore N
start N workers that walk through all of memory 1 page at a time checking of
the page mapped and also is resident in memory using mincore(2).
.TP
.B \-\-mincore\-ops N
stop after N mincore bogo operations. One mincore bogo op is equivalent to a
1000 mincore(2) calls.
.TP
.B \-\-mincore\-random
instead of walking through pages sequentially, select pages at random. The
chosen address is iterated over by shifting it right one place and checked by
mincore until the address is less or equal to the page size.
.TP
.B \-\-mknod N
start N workers that create and remove fifos, empty files and named sockets
using mknod and unlink.
.TP
.B \-\-mknod\-ops N
stop directory thrash workers after N bogo mknod operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mlock N
start N workers that lock and unlock memory mapped pages using mlock(2),
munlock(2), mlockall(2) and munlockall(2). This is achieved by the mapping of
three contiguous pages and then locking the second page, hence ensuring
non-contiguous pages are locked . This is then repeated until the maximum
allowed mlocks or a maximum of 262144 mappings are made.  Next, all future
mappings are mlocked and the worker attempts to map 262144 pages, then all
pages are munlocked and the pages are unmapped.
.TP
.B \-\-mlock\-ops N
stop after N mlock bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap N
start N workers continuously calling mmap(2)/munmap(2).  The initial mapping
is a large chunk (size specified by \-\-mmap\-bytes) followed by pseudo-random
4K unmappings, then pseudo-random 4K mappings, and then linear 4K unmappings.
Note that this can cause systems to trip the kernel OOM killer on Linux
systems if not enough physical memory and swap is not available.  The
MAP_POPULATE option is used to populate pages into memory on systems that
support this.  By default, anonymous mappings are used, however, the
\-\-mmap\-file and \-\-mmap\-async options allow one to perform file based
mappings if desired.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-ops N
stop mmap stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-async
enable file based memory mapping and use asynchronous msync'ing on each page,
see \-\-mmap\-file.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-bytes N
allocate N bytes per mmap stress worker, the default is 256MB. One can specify
the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m
or g.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-file
enable file based memory mapping and by default use synchronous msync'ing on
each page.
.TP
.B \-\-mmap\-mprotect
change protection settings on each page of memory.  Each time a page or a
group of pages are mapped or remapped then this option will make the pages
read-only, write-only, exec-only, and read-write.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapfork N
start N workers that each fork off 32 child processes, each of which tries to
allocate some of the free memory left in the system (and trying to avoid
any swapping).  The child processes then hint that the allocation will be
needed with madvise(2) and then memset it to zero and hint that it is no longer
needed with madvise before exiting.  This produces significant amounts of VM
activity, a lot of cache misses and with minimal swapping.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapfork-ops N
stop after N mmapfork bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapmany N
start N workers that attempt to create the maximum allowed per-process memory
mappings. This is achieved by mapping 3 contiguous pages and then unmapping the
middle page hence splitting the mapping into two. This is then repeated until
the maximum allowed mappings or a maximum of 262144 mappings are made.
.TP
.B \-\-mmapmany\-ops N
stop after N mmapmany bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mremap N
start N workers continuously calling mmap(2), mremap(2) and munmap(2).  The
initial anonymous mapping is a large chunk (size specified by
\-\-mremap\-bytes) and then iteratively halved in size by remapping all the
way down to a page size and then back up to the original size.  This worker
is only available for Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-mremap\-ops N
stop mremap stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-mremap\-bytes N
initially allocate N bytes per remap stress worker, the default is 256MB. One
can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the
suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-msg N
start N sender and receiver processes that continually send and receive
messages using System V message IPC.
.TP
.B \-\-msg\-ops N
stop after N bogo message send operations completed.
.TP
.B \-\-msync N
start N stressors that msync data from a file backed memory mapping from
memory back to the file and msync modified data from the file back to the
mapped memory. This exercises the msync(2) MS_SYNC and MS_INVALIDATE sync
operations.
.TP
.B \-\-msync\-ops N
stop after N msync bogo operations completed.
.TP
.B \-\-msync\-bytes N
allocate N bytes for the memory mapped file, the default is 256MB. One
can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the
.TP
.B \-\-mq N
start N sender and receiver processes that continually send and receive
messages using POSIX message queues. (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-mq\-ops N
stop after N bogo POSIX message send operations completed.
.TP
.B \-\-mq\-size N
specify size of POSIX message queue. The default size is 10 messages and most
Linux systems this is the maximum allowed size for normal users. If the given
size is greater than the allowed message queue size then a warning is issued
and the maximum allowed size is used instead.
.TP
.B \-\-nice N
start N cpu consuming workers that exercise the available nice levels. Each
iteration forks off a child process that runs through the all the nice levels
running a busy loop for 0.1 seconds per level and then exits.
.TP
.B \-\-nice\-ops N
stop after N nice bogo nice loops
.TP
.B \-\-null N
start N workers writing to /dev/null.
.TP
.B \-\-null\-ops N
stop null stress workers after N /dev/null bogo write operations.
.TP
.B \-\-numa N
start N workers that migrate stressors and a 4MB memory mapped buffer around
all the available NUMA nodes.  This uses migrate_pages(2) to move the stressors
and mbind(2) and move_pages(2) to move the pages of the mapped buffer. After
each move, the buffer is written to force activity over the bus which results
cache misses.  This test will only run on hardware with NUMA enabled and more
than 1 NUMA node.
.TP
.B \-\-numa\-ops N
stop NUMA stress workers after N bogo NUMA operations.
.TP
.B \-\-oom\-pipe N
start N workers that create as many pipes as allowed and exercise expanding
and shrinking the pipes from the largest pipe size down to a page size. Data
is written into the pipes and read out again to fill the pipe buffers. With
the \-\-aggressive mode enabled the data is not read out when the pipes are
shrunk, causing the kernel to OOM processes aggressively.  Running many
instances of this stressor will force kernel to OOM processes due to the
many large pipe buffer allocations.
.TP
.B \-\-oom\-pipe\-ops N
stop after N bogo pipe expand/shrink operations.
.TP
.B \-\-opcode N
start N workers that fork off children that execute randomly generated
executable code.  This will generate issues such as illegal instructions,
bus errors, segmentation faults, traps, floating point errors that are
handled gracefully by the stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-opcode\-ops N
stop after N attempts to executate illegal code.
.TP
.B \-o N, \-\-open N
start N workers that perform open(2) and then close(2) operations on
/dev/zero. The maximum opens at one time is system defined, so the test will
run up to this maximum, or 65536 open file descriptors, which ever comes first.
.TP
.B \-\-open\-ops N
stop the open stress workers after N bogo open operations.
.TP
.B \-\-personality N
start N workers that attempt to set personality and get all the available
personality types (process execution domain types) via the personality(2)
system call. (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-personality\-ops N
stop personality stress workers after N bogo personality operations.
.TP
.B \-p N, \-\-pipe N
start N workers that perform large pipe writes and reads to exercise pipe I/O.
This exercises memory write and reads as well as context switching.  Each
worker has two processes, a reader and a writer.
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-ops N
stop pipe stress workers after N bogo pipe write operations.
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-data\-size N
specifies the size in bytes of each write to the pipe (range from 4 bytes
to 4096 bytes). Setting a small data size will cause more writes to be
buffered in the pipe, hence reducing the context switch rate between the
pipe writer and pipe reader processes. Default size is the page size.
.TP
.B \-\-pipe\-size N
specifies the size of the pipe in bytes (for systems that support the
F_SETPIPE_SZ fcntl() command). Setting a small pipe size will cause the pipe
to fill and block more frequently, hence increasing the context switch rate
between the pipe writer and the pipe reader processes. Default size is 512
bytes.
.TP
.B \-P N, \-\-poll N
start N workers that perform zero timeout polling via the poll(2), select(2)
and sleep(3) calls. This wastes system and user time doing nothing.
.TP
.B \-\-poll\-ops N
stop poll stress workers after N bogo poll operations.
.TP
.B \-\-procfs N
start N workers that read files from /proc and recursively read files from
/proc/self (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-procfs\-ops N
stop procfs reading after N bogo read operations. Note, since the number of
entries may vary between kernels, this bogo ops metric is probably very
misleading.
.TP
.B \-\-pthread N
start N workers that iteratively creates and terminates multiple pthreads
(the default is 1024 pthreads per worker). In each iteration, each newly
created pthread waits until the worker has created all the pthreads and then
they all terminate together.
.TP
.B \-\-pthread\-ops N
stop pthread workers after N bogo pthread create operations.
.TP
.B \-\-pthread\-max N
create N pthreads per worker. If the product of the number of pthreads by the
number of workers is greater than the soft limit of allowed pthreads then the
maximum is re-adjusted down to the maximum allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-ptrace N
start N workers that fork and trace system calls of a child process using
ptrace(2).
.TP
.B \-\-ptrace\-ops N
stop ptracer workers after N bogo system calls are traced.
.TP
.B \-\-pty N
start N workers that repeatedly attempt to open 65536 pseudoterminals and
perform various pty ioctls upon the ptys before closing them.
.TP
.B \-\-pty\-ops N
stop pty workers after N pty bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-Q, \-\-qsort N
start N workers that sort 32 bit integers using qsort.
.TP
.B \-\-qsort\-ops N
stop qsort stress workers after N bogo qsorts.
.TP
.B \-\-qsort\-size N
specify number of 32 bit integers to sort, default is 262144 (256 \(mu 1024).
.TP
.B \-\-quota N
start N workers that exercise the Q_GETQUOTA, Q_GETFMT, Q_GETINFO, Q_GETSTATS
and Q_SYNC quotactl(2) commands on all the available mounted block based file
systems.
.TP
.B \-\-\quota\-ops N
stop quota stress workers after N bogo quotactl operations.
.TP
.B \-\-rdrand N
start N workers that read the Intel hardware random number generator (Intel
Ivybridge processors upwards).
.TP
.B \-\-rdrand\-ops N
stop rdrand stress workers after N bogo rdrand operations (1 bogo op = 2048
random bits successfully read).
.TP
.B \-\-readahead N
start N workers that randomly seeks and performs 512 byte read/write I/O
operations on a file with readahead. The default file size is 1 GB.  Readaheads
and reads are batched into 16 readaheads and then 16 reads.
.TP
.B \-\-readahead\-bytes N
set the size of readahead file, the default is 1 GB. One can specify the size
in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

stop readahead stress workers after N bogo read operations.
.TP
.B \-\-remap N
start N workers that map 512 pages and re-order these pages using the
deprecated system call remap_file_pages(2). Several page re-orderings are
exercised: forward, reverse, random and many pages to 1 page.
.TP
.B \-\-remap\-ops N
stop after N remapping bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-R N, \-\-rename N
start N workers that each create a file and then repeatedly rename it.
.TP
.B \-\-rename\-ops N
stop rename stress workers after N bogo rename operations.

.B \-\-rlimit N
start N workers that exceed CPU and file size resource imits, generating
SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ signals.
.TP
.B \-\-rlimit\-ops N
stop after N bogo resource limited SIGXCPU and SIGXFSZ signals have been caught.
.TP
.B \-\-rtc N
start N workers that exercise the real time clock (RTC) interfaces via /dev/rtc
and /sys/class/rtc/rtc0. No destructive writes (modifications) are performed on
the RTC. This is a Linux only stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-rtc\-ops N
stop after N bogo RTC interface accesses.
.TP
.B \-\-seal N
start N workers that exercise the fcntl(2) SEAL commands on a small anonymous
file created using memfd_create(2).  After each SEAL command is issued the
stessor also sanity checks if the seal operation has sealed the file correctly.
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-seal\-ops N
stop after N bogo seal operations.
.TP
.B \-\-seccomp N
start N workers that exercise Secure Computing system call filtering. Each
worker creates child processes that write a short message to /dev/null and then
exits. 2% of the child processes have a seccomp filter that disallows
the write system call and hence it is killed by seccomp with a SIGSYS.  Note
that this stressor can generate many audit log messages each time the child is
killed.
.TP
.B \-\-seccomp-ops N
stop seccomp stress workers after N seccomp filter tests.
.TP
.B \-\-seek N
start N workers that randomly seeks and performs 512 byte read/write I/O
operations on a file. The default file size is 16 GB.

punch randomly located 8K holes into the file to cause more extents to force
a more demanding seek stressor, (Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-seek\-size N
specify the size of the file in bytes. Small file sizes allow the I/O to occur
in the cache, causing greater CPU load. Large file sizes force more I/O
operations to drive causing more wait time and more I/O on the drive. One can
specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix
b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-sem N
start N workers that perform POSIX semaphore wait and post operations. By
default, a parent and 4 children are started per worker to provide some
contention on the semaphore. This stresses fast semaphore operations and
produces rapid context switching.
.TP
.B \-\-sem\-ops N
stop semaphore stress workers after N bogo semaphore operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sem\-procs N
start N child workers per worker to provide contention on the semaphore, the
default is 4 and a maximum of 64 are allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-sem\-sysv N
start N workers that perform System V semaphore wait and post operations. By
default, a parent and 4 children are started per worker to provide some
contention on the semaphore. This stresses fast semaphore operations and
produces rapid context switching.

.B \-\-sem\-sysv\-procs N
start N child processes per worker to provide contention on the System V
semaphore, the default is 4 and a maximum of 64 are allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-sendfile N
start N workers that send an empty file to /dev/null. This operation spends
nearly all the time in the kernel.  The default sendfile size is 4MB.  The
sendfile options are for Linux only.
.TP
.B \-\-sendfile\-ops N
stop sendfile workers after N sendfile bogo operations.

using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-shm N
start N workers that open and allocate shared memory objects using the POSIX
shared memory interfaces.  By default, the test will repeatedly create and
destroy 32 shared memory objects, each of which is 8MB in size.
.TP

stop after N POSIX shared memory create and destroy bogo operations are
complete.

.TP
.B \-\-shm\-objs N
specify the number of shared memory objects to be created.
.TP
.B \-\-shm\-sysv N
start N workers that allocate shared memory using the System V shared memory
interface.  By default, the test will repeatedly create and destroy 8 shared
memory segments, each of which is 8MB in size.

.B \-\-shm\-sysv\-segs N
specify the number of shared memory segments to be created.
.TP
.B \-\-sigfd N
start N workers that generate SIGRT signals and are handled by reads by a child
process using a file descriptor set up using signalfd(2).  (Linux only). This
will generate a heavy context switch load when all CPUs are fully loaded.
.TP
.B \-\-sigfd\-ops
stop sigfd workers after N bogo SIGUSR1 signals are sent.
.TP
.B \-\-sigfpe N
start N workers that rapidly cause division by zero SIGFPE faults.
.TP
.B \-\-sigfpe\-ops N
stop sigfpe stress workers after N bogo SIGFPE faults.
.TP
.B \-\-sigpending N
start N workers that check if SIGUSR1 signals are pending. This stressor masks
SIGUSR1, generates a SIGUSR1 signal and uses sigpending(2) to see if the signal
is pending. Then it unmasks the signal and checks if the signal is no longer
pending.
.TP
.B \-\-signpending-ops N
stop sigpending stress workers after N bogo sigpending pending/unpending checks.
.TP
.B \-\-sigsegv N
start N workers that rapidly create and catch segmentation faults.

stop sigsegv stress workers after N bogo segmentation faults.
.TP
.B \-\-sigsuspend N
start N workers that each spawn off 4 child processes that wait for a SIGUSR1
signal from the parent using sigsuspend(2). The parent sends SIGUSR1 signals
to each child in rapid succession.  Each sigsuspend wakeup is counted as one
bogo operation.
.TP
.B \-\-sigsuspend-ops N
stop sigsuspend stress workers after N bogo sigsuspend wakeups.
.TP
.B \-\-sigq N
start N workers that rapidly send SIGUSR1 signals using sigqueue(3) to child
processes that wait for the signal via sigwaitinfo(2).

stop sigq stress workers after N bogo signal send operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sleep N
start N workers that spawn off multiple threads that each perform multiple
sleeps of ranges 1us to 0.1s.  This creates multiple context switches and
timer interrupts.
.TP
.B \-\-sleep\-ops N
stop after N sleep bogo operations.

start N workers that perform various socket stress activity. This involves a
pair of client/server processes performing rapid connect, send and receives
and disconnects on the local host.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-domain D
specify the domain to use, the default is ipv4. Currently ipv4, ipv6 and unix
are supported.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-nodelay
This disables the TCP Nagle algorithm, so data segments are always sent
as soon as possible.  This stops data from being buffered before being
transmitted, hence resulting in poorer network utilisation and more context
switches between the sender and receiver.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-port P
start at socket port P. For N socket worker processes, ports P to P - 1 are
used.

by default, messages are sent using send(2). This option allows one to specify
the sending method using send(2), sendmsg(2) or sendmmsg(2).  Note that
sendmmsg is only available for Linux systems that support this system call.
.TP
.B \-\-sock\-type [ stream | seqpacket ]
specify the socket type to use. The default type is stream. seqpacket currently
only works for the unix socket domain.
.TP
.B \-\-sockfd N
start N workers that pass file descriptors over a UNIX domain socket using the
CMSG(3) ancillary data mechanism. For each worker, pair of client/server
processes are created, the server opens as many file descriptors on /dev/null
as possible and passing these over the socket to a client that reads these from
the CMSG data and immediately closes the files.
.TP
.B \-\-sockfd\-ops N
stop sockfd stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-sockpair N
start N workers that perform socket pair I/O read/writes. This involves a pair

in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-stack N
start N workers that rapidly cause and catch stack overflows by use of
alloca(3).
.TP
.B \-\-stack\-full
the default action is to touch the lowest page on each stack allocation. This
option touches all the pages by filling the new stack allocation with zeros
which forces physical pages to be allocated and hence is more aggressive.
.TP
.B \-\-stack\-ops N
stop stack stress workers after N bogo stack overflows.
.TP
.B \-\-stackmmap N
start N workers that use a 2MB stack that is memory mapped onto a temporary
file. A recursive function works down the stack and flushes dirty stack pages
back to the memory mapped file using msync(2) until the end of the stack is
reached (stack overflow). This exercises dirty page and stack exception handling.
.TP
.B \-\-stackmmap\-ops N
stop workers after N stack overflows have occurred.

stop after N bogo string operations.
.TP
.B \-\-stream N
start N workers exercising a memory bandwidth stressor loosely based on the
STREAM "Sustainable Memory Bandwidth in High Performance Computers" benchmarking
tool by John D. McCalpin, Ph.D.  This stressor allocates buffers that are at
least 4 times the size of the CPU L2 cache and continually performs rounds of
following computations on large arrays of double precision floating point numbers:

Specify the CPU Level 3 cache size in bytes.  One can specify the size in
units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

start N workers that recursively read files from /sys (Linux only).  This may
cause specific kernel drivers to emit messages into the kernel log.

.TP
.B \-\-tlb\-shootdown N
start N workers that force Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) shootdowns.
This is achieved by creating upto 16 child processes that all share a
region of memory and these processes are shared amongst the available
CPUs.  The processes adjust the page mapping settings causing TLBs to
be force flushed on the other processors, causing the TLB shootdowns.

memory region and handle these faults using the user space fault handling via
the userfaultfd mechanism.  This will generate a large quanity of major page
faults and also context switches during the handling of the page faults.
(Linux only).
.TP
.B \-\-userfaultfd-ops N
stop userfaultfd stress workers after N page faults.
.TP
.B \-\-userfaultfd-bytes N

One can specify the size in units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using
the suffix b, k, m or g.
.TP
.B \-\-utime N
start N workers updating file timestamps. This is mainly CPU bound when the
default is used as the system flushes metadata changes only periodically.
.TP
.B \-\-utime\-ops N
stop utime stress workers after N utime bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-utime\-fsync
force metadata changes on each file timestamp update to be flushed to disk.
This forces the test to become I/O bound and will result in many dirty metadata
writes.
.TP
.B \-\-vecmath N
start N workers that perform various unsigned integer math operations on
various 128 bit vectors. A mix of vector math operations are performed on the
following vectors: 16 \(mu 8 bits, 8 \(mu 16 bits, 4 \(mu 32 bits, 2 \(mu 64
bits. The metrics produced by this mix depend on the processor architecture
and the vector math optimisations produced by the compiler.

.TP
.B \-\-vfork N
start N workers continually vforking children that immediately exit.
.TP
.B \-\-vfork\-ops N
stop vfork stress workers after N bogo operations.
.TP
.B \-\-vfork\-max P
create P processes and then wait for them to exit per iteration. The default
is just 1; higher values will create many temporary zombie processes that are
waiting to be reaped. One can potentially fill up the the process table using
high values for \-\-vfork\-max and \-\-vfork.
.TP
.B \-m N, \-\-vm N
start N workers continuously calling mmap(2)/munmap(2) and writing to the
allocated memory. Note that this can cause systems to trip the kernel OOM
killer on Linux systems if not enough physical memory and swap is not
available.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-bytes N
mmap N bytes per vm worker, the default is 256MB. One can specify the size in
units of Bytes, KBytes, MBytes and GBytes using the suffix b, k, m or g.

.TP
.B \-\-vm\-ops N

.B \-\-vm\-hang N
sleep N seconds before unmapping memory, the default is zero seconds.
Specifying 0 will do an infinite wait.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-keep
do not continually unmap and map memory, just keep on re-writing to it.
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-locked
Lock the pages of the mapped region into memory using mmap MAP_LOCKED (since
Linux 2.5.37).  This is similar to locking memory as described in mlock(2).
.TP
.B \-\-vm\-method m
specify a vm stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised
sequentially, however one can specify just one method to be used if required.
Each of the vm workers have 3 phases:
.RS
.PP
1. Initialised. The anonymously memory mapped region is set to a known pattern.
.PP
2. Exercised. Memory is modified in a known predictable way. Some vm workers
alter memory sequentially, some use small or large strides to step along memory.
.PP
3. Checked. The modified memory is checked to see if it matches the expected
result.
.PP
The vm methods containing 'prime' in their name have a stride of the largest
prime less than 2^64, allowing to them to thoroughly step through memory and
touch all locations just once while also doing without touching memory cells
next to each other. This strategy exercises the cache and page non-locality.
.PP
Since the memory being exercised is virtually mapped then there is no
guarantee of touching page addresses in any particular physical order.  These
workers should not be used to test that all the system's memory is working
correctly either, use tools such as memtest86 instead.
.PP
The vm stress methods are intended to exercise memory in ways to possibly find
memory issues and to try to force thermal errors.
.PP
Available vm stress methods are described as follows:
.TS
expand;
lBw(10n)2 lBw(\n[SV]n)
l l.
Method	Description
all	T{
iterate over all the vm stress methods as listed below.
T}
flip	T{
sequentially work through memory 8 times, each time just one bit in memory
flipped (inverted). This will effectively invert each byte in 8 passes.
T}
galpat-0	T{
galloping pattern zeros. This sets all bits to 0 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits
to 1. It then checks to see if the 1s are pulled down to 0 by their neighbours
or of the neighbours have been pulled up to 1.
T}
galpat-1	T{
galloping pattern ones. This sets all bits to 1 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits
to 0. It then checks to see if the 0s are pulled up to 1 by their neighbours
or of the neighbours have been pulled down to 0.
T}
gray	T{
fill the memory with sequential gray codes (these only change 1 bit at a time
between adjacent bytes) and then check if they are set correctly.
T}
incdec	T{
work sequentially through memory twice, the first pass increments each byte by
a specific value and the second pass decrements each byte back to the original
start value. The increment/decrement value changes on each invocation of the
stressor.
T}
inc-nybble	T{
initialise memory to a set value (that changes on each invocation of the
stressor) and then sequentially work through each byte incrementing the bottom
4 bits by 1 and the top 4 bits by 15.
T}
rand-set	T{
sequentially work through memory in 64 bit chunks setting bytes in the chunk
to the same 8 bit random value.  The random value changes on each chunk.
Check that the values have not changed.
T}
rand-sum	T{
sequentially set all memory to random values and then summate the number of
bits that have changed from the original set values.
T}
read64	T{
sequentially read memory using 32 x 64 bit reads per bogo loop. Each loop
equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory reads.
T}
ror	T{
fill memory with a random pattern and then sequentially rotate 64 bits of
memory right by one bit, then check the final load/rotate/stored values.
T}
swap	T{
fill memory in 64 byte chunks with random patterns. Then swap each 64 chunk
with a randomly chosen chunk. Finally, reverse the swap to put the chunks back
to their original place and check if the data is correct. This exercises
adjacent and random memory load/stores.
T}
move-inv	T{
sequentially fill memory 64 bits of memory at a time with random values, and
then check if the memory is set correctly.  Next, sequentially invert each 64
bit pattern and again check if the memory is set as expected.
T}
modulo-x	T{
fill memory over 23 iterations. Each iteration starts one byte further along
from the start of the memory and steps along in 23 byte strides. In each
stride, the first byte is set to a random pattern and all other bytes are set
to the inverse.  Then it checks see if the first byte contains the expected
random pattern. This exercises cache store/reads as well as seeing if
neighbouring cells influence each other.
T}
prime-0	T{
iterate 8 times by stepping through memory in very large prime strides clearing
just on bit at a time in every byte. Then check to see if all bits are set to
zero.
T}
prime-1	T{
iterate 8 times by stepping through memory in very large prime strides setting
just on bit at a time in every byte. Then check to see if all bits are set to
one.
T}
prime-gray-0	T{
first step through memory in very large prime strides clearing just on bit
(based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but clear the other
7 bits. Then check to see if all bits are set to zero.
T}
prime-gray-1	T{
first step through memory in very large prime strides setting just on bit
(based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but set the other 7
bits. Then check to see if all bits are set to one.
T}
rowhammer	T{
try to force memory corruption using the rowhammer memory stressor. This
fetches two 32 bit integers from memory and forces a cache flush on the two
addresses multiple times. This has been known to force bit flipping on some
hardware, especially with lower frequency memory refresh cycles.
T}
walk-0d	T{
for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to low (and
the others are set high) and check that the written value is as expected. This
checks if any data lines are stuck.
T}
walk-1d	T{
for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to high (and
the others are set low) and check that the written value is as expected. This
checks if any data lines are stuck.
T}
walk-0a	T{
in the given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses
working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck low. This
works best with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual
addresses has some value too.
T}
walk-1a	T{
in the given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses
working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck high. This
works best with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual
addresses has some value too.
T}
write64	T{
sequentially write memory using 32 x 64 bit writes per bogo loop. Each loop
equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory writes.  Note that
memory writes are not checked at the end of each test iteration.
T}
zero-one	T{
set all memory bits to zero and then check if any bits are not zero. Next, set
all the memory bits to one and check if any bits are not one.

the settings (memory sizes, file allocations, etc.) and select the most
demanding/aggressive options.
.LP
stress\-ng \-\-random 32 \-x numa,hdd,key
.IP
run 32 randomly selected stressors and exclude the numa, hdd and key stressors
.LP
stress\-ng \-\-sequential 4 \-\-class vm \-\-exclude bigheap,brk,stack
.IP
run 4 instances of the VM stressors one after each other, excluding the
bigheap, brk and stack stressors

Status	Description
0	T{
Success.
T}
1	T{
Error; incorrect user options or a fatal resource issue in the stress-ng
stressor harness (for example, out of memory).
T}
2	T{
One or more stressors failed.
T}
3	T{
One or more stressors failed to initialise because of lack of resources,
for example ENOMEM (no memory), ENOSPC (no space on file system) or a

.SH AUTHOR
stress\-ng was written by Colin King <colin.king@canonical.com> and
is a clean room re-implementation and extension of the original
stress tool by Amos Waterland <apw@rossby.metr.ou.edu>. Thanks also for
contributions from Christian Ehrhardt, James Hunt, Jim Rowan,
Tim Gardner, Luca Pizzamiglio and Zhiyi Sun.
.SH NOTES
Note that the stress\-ng cpu, io, vm and hdd tests are different
implementations of the original stress
tests and hence may produce different stress characteristics.
stress\-ng does not support any GPU stress tests.
.PP
The bogo operations metrics may change with each release  because of bug
fixes to the code, new features, compiler optimisations or changes in system
call performance.
