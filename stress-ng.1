.SH NAME
stress\-ng \- stress "next generation", a tool to load and stress a computer system
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B stress\-ng
[\fIOPTION \fR[\fIARG\fR]] ...
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
stress\-ng will stress test a computer system in various selectable ways. It
was designed to exercise various physical subsystems of a computer as well
as the various operating system kernel interfaces.
stress\-ng also has a wide range of CPU specific stress tests that exercise
floating point, integer, bit manipulation and control flow.
.PP
stress\-ng was originally intended to make a machine work hard and trip
hardware issues such as thermal overruns as well as operating
system bugs that only occur when a system is being thrashed hard. Use
stress\-ng with caution as some of the tests can make a system run hot
on poorly designed hardware and also can cause excessive system thrashing
which may be difficult to stop.
.PP
stress\-ng can also measure test throughput rates; this can be
useful to observe performance changes across different
operating system releases or types of hardware. However, it has never been
intended to be used as a precise benchmark test suite, so do NOT use it
in this manner.
.PP
Running stress\-ng with root privileges will adjust out of memory settings
on Linux systems to make the stressors unkillable in low memory situations,
so use this judiciously.  With the appropriate privilege, stress\-ng can allow
the ionice class and ionice levels to be adjusted, again, this should be
used with care.
.PP
One can specify the number of processes to invoke per type of stress test;
specifying a zero value will select the number of processors
available as defined by sysconf(_SC_NPROCESSORS_CONF), if that can't be
determined then the number of online CPUs is used.  If the value is less
than zero then the number of online CPUs is used.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.B General stress\-ng control options:
.TP
.B \-\-abort
this option will force all running stressors to abort (terminate) if any
other stressor terminates prematurely because of a failure.
.TP
.B \-\-aggressive
enables more file, cache and memory aggressive options. This may slow tests
down, increase latencies and reduce the number of bogo ops as well as changing
the balance of user time vs system time used depending on the type of stressor
being used.
.TP
.B \-a N, \-\-all N, \-\-parallel N
start N instances of all stressors in parallel. If N is less than zero, then
the number of CPUs online is used for the number of instances.  If N is zero,
then the number of configured CPUs in the system is used.
.TP
.B \-b N, \-\-backoff N
wait N microseconds between the start of each stress worker process. This
allows one to ramp up the stress tests over time.
.TP
.B \-\-change\-cpu
this forces child processes of some stressors to change to a different CPU from the
parent on startup. Note that during the execution of the stressor the scheduler
may choose move the parent onto the same CPU as the child. The stressors affected
by this option are client/server style stressors, such as the network stressors
(sock, sockmany, udp, etc) or context switching stressors (switch, pipe, etc).
.TP
.B \-\-class name
specify the class of stressors to run. Stressors are classified into one or
more of the following classes: cpu, cpu\-cache, device, gpu, io, interrupt,
filesystem, memory, network, os, pipe, scheduler, signal and vm.  Some stressors
fall into just one class. For example the 'get' stressor is just in the 'os'
class. Other stressors fall into more than one class, for example,
the 'lsearch' stressor falls into the 'cpu', 'cpu\-cache' and 'memory' classes
as it exercises all these three.  Selecting a specific class will run all
the stressors that fall into that class only when run with the \-\-sequential
option.

Specifying a name followed by a question mark (for example \-\-class vm?) will
print out all the stressors in that specific class.
.TP
.B \-\-config
print out the configuration used to build stress-ng.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-dry\-run
parse options, but do not run stress tests. A no-op.
.TP
.B \-\-ftrace
enable kernel function call tracing (Linux only).  This will use the
kernel debugfs ftrace mechanism to record all the kernel functions
used on the system while stress\-ng is running.  This is only as accurate
as the kernel ftrace output, so there may be some variability on the
data reported.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
show help.
.TP
.B \-\-ignite\-cpu
alter kernel controls to try and maximize the CPU. This requires root
privilege to alter various /sys interface controls.  Currently this only
works for Intel P-State enabled x86 systems on Linux.
.TP
.B \-\-interrupts
check for any system management interrupts or error interrupts that occur,
for example thermal overruns, machine check exceptions, etc. Note that the
interrupts are accounted to all the concurrently running stressors, so total
count for all stressors is over accounted.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice\-class class
specify ionice class (only on Linux). Can be idle (default), besteffort, be,
realtime, rt.
.TP
.B \-\-ionice\-level level
specify ionice level (only on Linux). For idle, 0 is the only possible
option. For besteffort or realtime values 0 (highest priority) to 7 (lowest
priority). See ionice(1) for more details.
.TP
.B \-\-iostat S
every S seconds show I/O statistics on the device that stores the stress\-ng
temporary files. This is either the device of the current working directory
or the \-\-temp\-path specified path. Currently a Linux only option.
The fields output are:

.TP
.B \-\-job jobfile
run stressors using a jobfile.  The jobfile is essentially a file containing
stress\-ng options (without the leading \-\-) with one option per line. Lines
may have comments with comment text proceeded by the # character. A simple
example is as follows:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\f[CR]
run sequential   # run stressors sequentially
verbose          # verbose output
metrics-brief    # show metrics at end of run
timeout 60s      # stop each stressor after 60 seconds
#
# vm stressor options:
#
vm 2             # 2 vm stressors
vm-bytes 128M    # 128MB available memory
vm-keep          # keep vm mapping
vm-populate      # populate memory
#
# memcpy stressor options:
#
memcpy 5         # 5 memcpy stressors
\f[]
.fi
.RE
.RS
.PP
The job file introduces the run command that specifies how to run the
stressors:
.PP
run sequential \- run stressors sequentially
.br
run parallel \- run stressors together in parallel
.PP
Note that 'run parallel' is the default.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-keep\-files
do not remove files and directories created by the stressors. This can be
useful for debugging purposes. Not generally recommended as it can fill up
a file system.
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-keep\-name
by default, stress\-ng will attempt to change the name of the stress
processes according to their functionality; this option disables this and
keeps the process names to be the name of the parent process, that is,
stress\-ng.
.TP
.B \-\-klog\-check
check the kernel log for kernel error and warning messages and report these
as soon as they are detected. Linux only and requires root capability to read
the kernel log.
.TP
.B \-\-ksm
enable kernel samepage merging (Linux only). This is a memory-saving de-duplication
feature for merging anonymous (private) pages.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-brief
by default stress\-ng will report the name of the program, the message type
and the process id as a prefix to all output. The \-\-log\-brief option will
output messages without these fields to produce a less verbose output.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-file filename
write messages to the specified log file.
.TP
.B \-\-log\-lockless
log messages use a lock to avoid intermingling of blocks of stressor messages,
however this may cause contention when emitting a high rate of logging messages
in verbose mode and many stressors are running, for example when testing CPU
scaling with many processes on many CPUs. This option disables log message
locking.
.TP
.B \-\-maximize
overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the maximum
settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor
settings options if required.
.TP
.B \-\-max\-fd N
set the maximum limit on file descriptors (value or a % of system allowed
maximum).  By default, stress\-ng can use all the available file descriptors;
this option sets the limit in the range from 10 up to the maximum limit of
RLIMIT_NOFILE.  One can use a % setting too, e.g. 50% is half the maximum
allowed file descriptors.  Note that stress\-ng will use about 5 of the
available file descriptors so take this into consideration when using this
setting.
.TP
.B \-\-mbind list
set strict NUMA memory allocation based on the list of NUMA nodes provided;
page allocations will come from the node with sufficient free memory closest
to the specified node(s) where the allocation takes place. This uses the
Linux set_mempolicy(2) call using the MPOL_BIND mode.  The NUMA nodes to be
used are specified by a comma separated list of node (0 to N-1). One can
specify a range of NUMA nodes using '-', for example: \-\-mbind 0,2-3,6,7-11
.TP
.B \-\-metrics
output number of bogo operations in total performed by the stress processes.
Note that these are
.B not a reliable metric of performance or throughput
and
.B
have not been designed to be used for benchmarking whatsoever.
Some stressors have additional metrics that are more useful than bogo-ops, and
these are generally more useful for observing how a system behaves when under
various kinds of load.
.RS
.PP
The following columns of information are output:
.TS
lB lB
l lx.
Column Heading	Explanation
T{
bogo ops
T}	T{
number of iterations of the stressor during the run. This is metric of
how much overall "work" has been achieved in bogo operations.
.B
Do not use this as a reliable measure of throughput for benchmarking.
T}
T{
real time (secs)
T}	T{
average wall clock duration (in seconds) of the stressor. This is the total
wall clock time of all the instances of that particular stressor divided by
the number of these stressors being run.
T}
T{
usr time (secs)
T}	T{
total user time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the
stressor.
T}
T{
sys time (secs)
T}	T{
total system time (in seconds) consumed running all the instances of the
stressor.
T}
T{
bogo ops/s (real time)
T}	T{
total bogo operations per second based on wall clock run time. The wall clock
time reflects the apparent run time. The more processors one has on a system
the more the work load can be distributed onto these and hence the wall clock
time will reduce and the bogo ops rate will increase.  This is essentially
the "apparent" bogo ops rate of the system.
T}
T{
bogo ops/s (usr+sys time)
T}	T{
total bogo operations per second based on cumulative user and system time.
This is the real bogo ops rate of the system taking into consideration the
actual time execution time of the stressor across all the processors.
Generally this will decrease as one adds more concurrent stressors due to
contention on cache, memory, execution units, buses and I/O devices.
T}
T{
CPU used per instance (%)
T}	T{
total percentage of CPU used divided by number of stressor instances. 100%
is 1 full CPU. Some stressors run multiple threads so it is possible to have
a figure greater than 100%.
T}
T{
RSS Max (KB)
T}	T{
resident set size (RSS), the portion of memory (measured in Kilobytes) occupied by a process in main memory.
T}
.TE
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-metrics\-brief
show shorter list of stressor metrics (no CPU used per instance).
.TP
.B \-\-minimize
overrides the default stressor settings and instead sets these to the minimum
settings allowed.  These defaults can always be overridden by the per stressor
settings options if required.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-madvise
from version 0.02.26 stress\-ng automatically calls madvise(2) with random
advise options before each mmap and munmap to stress the vm subsystem a
little harder. The \-\-no\-advise option turns this default off.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-oom\-adjust
disable any form of out-of-memory score adjustments, keep the system defaults.
Normally stress\-ng will adjust the out-of-memory scores on stressors to try
to create more memory pressure. This option disables the adjustments.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-rand\-seed
Do not seed the stress\-ng pseudo\-random number generator with a quasi random
start seed, but instead seed it with constant values. This forces tests to
run each time using the same start conditions which can be useful when one
requires reproducible stress tests.
.TP
.B \-\-oom\-avoid
Attempt to avoid out-of-memory conditions that can lead to the Out-of-Memory
(OOM) killer terminating stressors. This checks for low memory scenarios and
swapping before making memory allocations and hence adds some overhead to the
stressors and will slow down stressor allocation speeds.
.TP
.B \-\-oom\-avoid\-bytes N
Specify a low memory threshold to avoid making any further memory allocations.
The parameter can be specified as an absolute number of bytes (e.g. 2M for 2MB)
or a percentage of the current free memory, e.g. 5% (the default is 2.5%).
This option implicitly enables \-\-oom\-avoid.  The option allows the system
to have enough free memory to try to avoid the out-of-memory killer terminating
processes.
.TP
.B \-\-oomable
Do not respawn a stressor if it gets killed by the Out-of-Memory (OOM) killer.
The default behaviour is to restart a new instance of a stressor if the kernel
OOM killer terminates the process. This option disables this default
behaviour.
.TP
.B \-\-page\-in
touch allocated pages that are not in core, forcing them to be paged back in.
This is a useful option to force all the allocated pages to be paged in when
using the bigheap, mmap and vm stressors.  It will severely degrade
performance when the memory in the system is less than the allocated buffer
sizes.  This uses mincore(2) to determine the pages that are not in core and
hence need touching to page them back in.
.TP
.B \-\-pathological
enable stressors that are known to hang systems. Some stressors can
rapidly consume resources that may hang a system, or perform actions that
can lock a system up or cause it to reboot. These stressors are not enabled
by default, this option enables them, but you probably don't want to do this.
You have been warned. This option applies to the stressors: bad\-ioctl,
bind\-mount, cpu\-online, mlockmany, oom\-pipe, smi, sysinval and watchdog.
.TP
.B \-\-perf
measure processor and system activity using perf events. Linux only and
caveat emptor, according to perf_event_open(2): "Always double-check your
results! Various generalized events have had wrong values.".  Note that
with Linux 4.7 one needs to have CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities for this
option to work, or adjust  /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid to below
2 to use this without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
.TP
.B \-\-permute N
run all permutations of the selected stressors with N instances of the
permutated stressors per run.  If N is less than zero, then the number
of CPUs online is used for the number of instances. If N is zero, then
the number of configured CPUs in the system is used.  This will perform
multiple runs with all the permutations of the stressors. Use this in
conjunction with the \-\-with or \-\-class option to specify the stressors
to permute.
.TP
.B \-\-progress
display the run progress when running stressors with the \-\-sequential
option.
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
do not show any output.
.TP
.B \-r N, \-\-random N
start N random stress workers. If N is 0, then the number of configured
processors is used for N.
.TP
.B \-\-sched scheduler
select the named scheduler (only on Linux). To see the list of available
schedulers use: stress\-ng \-\-sched which
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-prio prio
select the scheduler priority level (only on Linux). If the scheduler does
not support this then the default priority level of 0 is chosen.
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-period period
select the period parameter for deadline scheduler (only on Linux). Default
value is 0 (in nanoseconds).
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-runtime runtime
select the runtime parameter for deadline scheduler (only on Linux). Default
value is 99999 (in nanoseconds).
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-deadline deadline
select the deadline parameter for deadline scheduler (only on Linux). Default
value is 100000 (in nanoseconds).
.TP
.B \-\-sched\-reclaim
use cpu bandwidth reclaim feature for deadline scheduler (only on Linux).
.TP
.B \-\-seed N
set the random number generate seed with a 64 bit value. Allows stressors to
use the same random number generator sequences on each invocation.
.TP
.B \-\-settings
show the various option settings.
.TP
.B \-\-sequential N
sequentially run all the stressors one by one for a default of 60 seconds. The
number of instances of each of the individual stressors to be started is N.  If
N is less than zero, then the number of CPUs online is used for the number
of instances.  If N is zero, then the number of CPUs in the system is used.
Use the \-\-timeout option to specify the duration to run each stressor.
.TP
.B \-\-skip\-silent
silence messages that report that a stressor has been skipped because it
requires features not supported by the system, such as unimplemented system
calls, missing resources or processor specific features.
.TP
.B \-\-smart
scan the block devices for changes S.M.A.R.T. statistics (Linux only). This
requires root privileges to read the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
Technology data from all block devies and will report any changes in the
statistics. One caveat is that device manufacturers provide different sets
of data, the exact meaning of the data can be vague and the data may be
inaccurate.
.TP
.B \-\-sn
use scientific notation (e.g. 2.412e+01) for metrics.
.TP
.B \-\-status N
report every N seconds the number of running, exiting, reaped and failed stressors,
number of stressors that received SIGARLM termination signal as well as the current
run duration.
.TP
.B \-\-stderr
write messages to stderr. With version 0.15.08 output is written to stdout,
previously due to a historical oversight output went to stderr. This
option allows one to revert to the pre-0.15.08 behaviour.
.TP
.B \-\-stdout
all output goes to stdout. This is the new default for version 0.15.08. Use
the \-\-stderr option for the original behaviour.
.TP
.B \-\-stressors
output the names of the available stressors.
.TP
.B \-\-syslog
log output (except for verbose \-v messages) to the syslog.
.TP
.B \-\-taskset list
set CPU affinity based on the list of CPUs provided; stress\-ng is bound to
just use these CPUs (Linux only). The CPUs to be used are specified by a
comma separated list of CPU (0 to N-1). One can specify a range of CPUs
using '-', for example: \-\-taskset 0,2-3,6,7-11
.TP
.B \-\-temp\-path path
specify a path for stress\-ng temporary directories and temporary files;
the default path is the current working directory.  This path must have
read and write access for the stress\-ng stress processes.
.TP
.B \-\-thermalstat S
every S seconds show CPU and thermal load statistics. This option shows
average CPU frequency in GHz (average of online-CPUs), the minimum CPU
frequency, the maximum CPU frequency, load averages (1 minute, 5 minute
and 15 minutes) and available thermal zone temperatures in degrees
Centigrade.
.TP
.B \-\-thrash
This can only be used when running on Linux and with root privilege. This
option starts a background thrasher process that works through all the
processes on a system and tries to page as many pages in the processes
as possible. It also periodically drops the page cache, frees reclaimable
slab objects and pagecache. This will cause considerable amount of
thrashing of swap on an over-committed system.
.TP
.B \-t N, \-\-timeout T
run each stress test for at least T seconds. One can also specify the units
of time in seconds, minutes, hours, days or years with the suffix s, m, h,
d or y. Each stressor will be sent a SIGALRM signal at the timeout time, however
if the stress test is swapped out, in an uninterruptible system call or
performing clean up (such as removing hundreds of test file) it may take a
while to finally terminate.  A 0 timeout will run stress\-ng for ever with
no timeout. The default timeout is 24 hours.
.TP
.B \-\-times
show the cumulative user and system times of all the child processes at the
end of the stress run.  The percentage of utilisation of available CPU time is
also calculated from the number of on-line CPUs in the system.
.TP
.B \--timestamp
add a timestamp in hours, minutes, seconds and hundredths of a second to the
log output.
.TP
.B \-\-timer\-slack N
adjust the per process timer slack to N nanoseconds (Linux only). Increasing
the timer slack allows the kernel to coalesce timer events by adding some
fuzziness to timer expiration times and hence reduce wakeups.  Conversely,
decreasing the timer slack will increase wakeups.  A value of 0 for the
timer-slack will set the system default of 50,000 nanoseconds.
.TP
.B \-\-tz
collect temperatures from the available thermal zones on the machine (Linux
only).  Some devices may have one or more thermal zones, where as others may
have none.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
show all debug, warnings and normal information output.
.TP
.B \-\-verify
verify results when a test is run. This is not available on all tests. This
will sanity check the computations or memory contents from a test run and
report to stderr any unexpected failures.
.TP
.B \-\-verifiable
print the names of stressors that can be verified with the \-\-verify option.
.TP
.B \-V, \-\-version
show version of stress\-ng, version of toolchain used to build stress\-ng
and system information.
.TP
.B \-\-vmstat S
every S seconds show statistics about processes, memory, paging, block I/O,
interrupts, context switches, disks and cpu activity.  The output is similar
that to the output from the vmstat(8) utility. Not fully supported on various
UNIX systems.
.TP
.B \-\-with list
specify stressors to run when using the \-\-all, \-\-seq or \-\-permute options.
For example to run 5 instances of the cpu, hash, nop and vm stressors one after
another (sequentially) for 1 minute per stressor use:
.PP
.in +10n
.EX
\f[CR]stress\-ng \-\-seq 5 \-\-with cpu,hash,nop,vm \-\-timeout 1m\f[]
.EE
.in -10n
.PP
.TP
.B \-x, \-\-exclude list
specify a list of one or more stressors to exclude (that is, do not run them).
This is useful to exclude specific stressors when one selects many stressors
to run using the \-\-class option, \-\-sequential, \-\-all and \-\-random
options. Example, run the cpu class stressors concurrently and exclude the
numa and search stressors:
.IP
stress\-ng \-\-class cpu \-\-all 1 \-x numa,bsearch,hsearch,lsearch
.TP
.B \-Y, \-\-yaml filename
output gathered statistics to a YAML formatted file named 'filename'.

.B \-l P, \-\-cpu\-load P
load CPU with P percent loading for the CPU stress workers. 0 is effectively a
sleep (no load) and 100 is full loading.  The loading loop is broken into
compute time (load%) and sleep time (100% - load%). Accuracy depends on the
overall load of the processor and the responsiveness of the scheduler, so the
actual load may be different from the desired load.  Note that the number of
bogo CPU operations may not be linearly scaled with the load as some systems
employ CPU frequency scaling and so heavier loads produce an increased CPU
frequency and greater CPU bogo operations.

Note: This option only applies to the \-\-cpu stressor option and not to
all of the cpu class of stressors.
.TP
.B \-\-cpu\-load\-slice S
note \- this option is only useful when \-\-cpu\-load is less than 100%. The
CPU load is broken into multiple busy and idle cycles. Use this option to
specify the duration of a busy time slice.  A negative value for S specifies
the number of iterations to run before idling the CPU (e.g. -30 invokes 30
iterations of a CPU stress loop).  A zero value selects a random busy time
between 0 and 0.5 seconds.  A positive value for S specifies the number of
milliseconds to run before idling the CPU (e.g. 100 keeps the CPU busy for
0.1 seconds).  Specifying small values for S lends to small time slices and
smoother scheduling.  Setting \-\-cpu\-load as a relatively low value and
\-\-cpu\-load\-slice to be large will cycle the CPU between long idle and
busy cycles and exercise different CPU frequencies.  The thermal range of
the CPU is also cycled, so this is a good mechanism to exercise the scheduler,
frequency scaling and passive/active thermal cooling mechanisms.

Note: This option only applies to the \-\-cpu stressor option and not to
all of the cpu class of stressors.

as of version V0.14.02 the cpu stressor now normalizes each of the cpu
stressor method bogo-op counters to try and ensure a similar bogo-op rate
for all the methods to avoid the shorter running (and faster) methods from
skewing the bogo-op rates when using the default "all" method.
This is based on a reference Intel i5-8350U processor and hence the bogo-ops
normalizing factors will be skew somewhat on different CPUs, but so
significantly as the original bogo-op counter rates. To disable the normalization

start N workers that use finit_module() to load the module specified

modprobe we can simply run the userspace modprobe program in a loop. To stress
test the kernel module autoloader we can stress tests using the upstream
kernel tools/testing/selftests/kmod/kmod.sh. This ends up calling modprobe
in the end, and it has its own caps built-in to self protect the kernel from
too many requests at the same time. The userspace modprobe call will also
prevent calls if the same module exists already. The stress\-ng modules
stressor is designed to help stress test the finit_module() system call
even if the module is already loaded, testing races that are
otherwise hard to reproduce.

start N workers exercising a memory bandwidth stressor very loosely based on the

Operation	Description
copy	T{
c[i] = a[i]

scale	T{
b[i] = scalar * c[i]

Since this is loosely based on a variant of the STREAM benchmark code,
DO NOT submit results based on this as it is intended to in stress\-ng just
to stress memory and compute and NOT intended for STREAM accurate
tuned or non-tuned benchmarking whatsoever. Use the official STREAM
benchmarking tool if you desire accurate and standardised STREAM benchmarks.

The stressor calculates the memory read rate, memory write rate and floating
point operations rate. These will differ from the maximum theoretical
read/write/compute rates because of loop overheads and the use of volatile
pointers to ensure the compiler does not optimize out stores.

.B \-\-vm\-method method
specify a vm stress method. By default, all the stress methods are exercised

Each of the vm workers have 3 phases:
.RS
.PP
1. Initialised. The anonymously memory mapped region is set to a known pattern.
.PP
2. Exercised. Memory is modified in a known predictable way. Some vm workers
alter memory sequentially, some use small or large strides to step along memory.
.PP
3. Checked. The modified memory is checked to see if it matches the expected
result.
.PP
The vm methods containing 'prime' in their name have a stride of the largest
prime less than 2\[ua]64, allowing to them to thoroughly step through memory and
touch all locations just once while also doing without touching memory cells
next to each other. This strategy exercises the cache and page non-locality.
.PP
Since the memory being exercised is virtually mapped then there is no
guarantee of touching page addresses in any particular physical order.  These
workers should not be used to test that all the system's memory is working
correctly either, use tools such as memtest86 instead.
.PP
The vm stress methods are intended to exercise memory in ways to possibly find
memory issues and to try to force thermal errors.
.PP

lB2 lB
l lx.
Method	Description
all	T{
iterate over all the vm stress methods as listed below.
T}
cache-lines	T{
work through memory in 64 byte cache sized steps writing a single byte
per cache line. Once the write is complete, the memory is read to verify
the values are written correctly.
T}
cache-stripe	T{
work through memory in 64 byte cache sized chunks, writing in ascending
address order on even offsets and descending address order on odd offsets.
T}
checkboard	T{
work through memory writing alternative zero/one bit values into memory
in a mixed checkerboard pattern. Memory is swapped around to ensure every
bit is read, bit flipped and re-written and then re-read for verification.
T}
flip	T{
sequentially work through memory 8 times, each time just one bit in memory
flipped (inverted). This will effectively invert each byte in 8 passes.
T}
fwdrev	T{
write to even addressed bytes in a forward direction and odd addressed bytes
in reverse direction. rhe contents are sanity checked once all the addresses
have been written to.
T}
galpat-0	T{
galloping pattern zeros. This sets all bits to 0 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits
to 1. It then checks to see if the 1s are pulled down to 0 by their neighbours
or of the neighbours have been pulled up to 1.
T}
galpat-1	T{
galloping pattern ones. This sets all bits to 1 and flips just 1 in 4096 bits
to 0. It then checks to see if the 0s are pulled up to 1 by their neighbours
or of the neighbours have been pulled down to 0.
T}
gray	T{
fill the memory with sequential gray codes (these only change 1 bit at a time
between adjacent bytes) and then check if they are set correctly.
T}
grayflip	T{
fill memory with adjacent bytes of gray code and inverted gray code pairs
to change as many bits at a time between adjacent bytes and check if
these are set correctly.
T}
incdec	T{
work sequentially through memory twice, the first pass increments each byte by
a specific value and the second pass decrements each byte back to the original
start value. The increment/decrement value changes on each invocation of the
stressor.
T}
inc-nybble	T{
initialise memory to a set value (that changes on each invocation of the
stressor) and then sequentially work through each byte incrementing the bottom
4 bits by 1 and the top 4 bits by 15.
T}
lfsr32	T{
fill memory with values generated from a 32 bit Galois linear feedback shift
register using the polynomial  x\[ua]32 + x\[ua]31 + x\[ua]29 + x + 1. This
generates a ring of  2\[ua]32 - 1 unique values (all 32 bit values except
for 0).
T}
rand-set	T{
sequentially work through memory in 64 bit chunks setting bytes in the chunk
to the same 8 bit random value.  The random value changes on each chunk.
Check that the values have not changed.
T}
rand-sum	T{
sequentially set all memory to random values and then summate the number of
bits that have changed from the original set values.
T}
read64	T{
sequentially read memory using 32 \(mu 64 bit reads per bogo loop. Each loop
equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory reads.
T}
ror	T{
fill memory with a random pattern and then sequentially rotate 64 bits of
memory right by one bit, then check the final load/rotate/stored values.
T}
swap	T{
fill memory in 64 byte chunks with random patterns. Then swap each 64 chunk
with a randomly chosen chunk. Finally, reverse the swap to put the chunks back
to their original place and check if the data is correct. This exercises
adjacent and random memory load/stores.
T}
move-inv	T{
sequentially fill memory 64 bits of memory at a time with random values, and
then check if the memory is set correctly.  Next, sequentially invert each 64
bit pattern and again check if the memory is set as expected.
T}
modulo-x	T{
fill memory over 23 iterations. Each iteration starts one byte further along
from the start of the memory and steps along in 23 byte strides. In each
stride, the first byte is set to a random pattern and all other bytes are set
to the inverse.  Then it checks see if the first byte contains the expected
random pattern. This exercises cache store/reads as well as seeing if
neighbouring cells influence each other.
T}
mscan	T{
fill each bit in each byte with 1s then check these are set, fill each bit
in each byte with 0s and check these are clear.
T}
prime-0	T{
iterate 8 times by stepping through memory in very large prime strides clearing
just on bit at a time in every byte. Then check to see if all bits are set to
zero.
T}
prime-1	T{
iterate 8 times by stepping through memory in very large prime strides setting
just on bit at a time in every byte. Then check to see if all bits are set to
one.
T}
prime-gray-0	T{
first step through memory in very large prime strides clearing just on bit
(based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but clear the other
7 bits. Then check to see if all bits are set to zero.
T}
prime-gray-1	T{
first step through memory in very large prime strides setting just on bit
(based on a gray code) in every byte. Next, repeat this but set the other 7
bits. Then check to see if all bits are set to one.
T}
rowhammer	T{
try to force memory corruption using the rowhammer memory stressor. This
fetches two 32 bit integers from memory and forces a cache flush on the two
addresses multiple times. This has been known to force bit flipping on some
hardware, especially with lower frequency memory refresh cycles.
T}
walk-0d	T{
for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to low (and
the others are set high) and check that the written value is as expected. This
checks if any data lines are stuck.
T}
walk-1d	T{
for each byte in memory, walk through each data line setting them to high (and
the others are set low) and check that the written value is as expected. This
checks if any data lines are stuck.
T}
walk-0a	T{
in the given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses
working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck low. This
works best with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual
addresses has some value too.
T}
walk-1a	T{
in the given memory mapping, work through a range of specially chosen addresses
working through address lines to see if any address lines are stuck high. This
works best with physical memory addressing, however, exercising these virtual
addresses has some value too.
T}
write64	T{
sequentially write to memory using 32 \(mu 64 bit writes per bogo loop. Each loop
equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory writes.  Note that
memory writes are not checked at the end of each test iteration.
T}
write64nt	T{
sequentially write to memory using 32 \(mu 64 bit non-temporal writes per bogo loop.
Each loop equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises cacheless raw memory writes
and is only available on x86 sse2 capable systems built with gcc and clang
compilers.  Note that memory writes are not checked at the end of each test iteration.
T}
write1024v	T{
sequentially write to memory using 1 \(mu 1024 bit vector write per bogo loop
(only available if the compiler supports vector types).
Each loop equates to one bogo operation.  This exercises raw memory writes.
Note that memory writes are not checked at the end of each test iteration.
T}
wrrd128nt	T{
write to memory in 128 bit chunks using non-temporal writes (bypassing the cache).
Each chunk is written 4 times to hammer the memory. Then check to see if the
data is correct using non-temporal reads if they are available or normal memory reads
if not. Only available with processors that provide non-temporal 128 bit writes.
T}
zero\-one	T{
set all memory bits to zero and then check if any bits are not zero. Next, set
all the memory bits to one and check if any bits are not one.

.B scheduler workload stressor
.RS 5
.TQ
.B \-\-workload N
start N workers that exercise the scheduler with items of work that
are started at random times with random sleep delays between work items. By
default a 100,000 microsecond slice of time has 100 work items
that start at random times during the slice. The work items by default run
for a quanta of 1000 microseconds scaled by the percentage work load (default of 30%).
For a slice of S microseconds and a work item quanta duration of Q microseconds,
S / Q work items are executed per slice. For a work load of L percent, the run time
per item is the quanta Q \(mu L / 100 microseconds.  The \-\-workload-\threads option
allows work items to be taken from a queue and run concurrently if the scheduling
run times overlap.
.br
If a work item is already running when a new work item is scheduled to run then
the new work item is delayed and starts directly after the completion of the
currently running work item when running with the default of zero worker threads.
This emulates bursty scheduled compute, such as handling input packets where
one may have lots of work items bunched together or with random unpredictable
delays between work items.
.TP

.SH AUTHOR
stress\-ng was written by Colin Ian King <colin.i.king@gmail.com> and
is a clean room re-implementation and extension of the original
stress tool by Amos Waterland. Thanks also to the many contributors
to stress\-ng. The README.md file in the source contains a full list
of the contributors.
.SH NOTES
Sending a SIGALRM, SIGINT or SIGHUP to stress\-ng causes it to
terminate all the stressor processes and ensures temporary files and
shared memory segments are removed cleanly.
.PP
Sending a SIGUSR2 to stress\-ng will dump out the current load average
and memory statistics.
.PP
Note that the stress\-ng cpu, io, vm and hdd tests are different
implementations of the original stress
tests and hence may produce different stress characteristics.
.PP
The bogo operations metrics may change with each release  because of bug
fixes to the code, new features, compiler optimisations, changes in support
libraries or system call performance.
